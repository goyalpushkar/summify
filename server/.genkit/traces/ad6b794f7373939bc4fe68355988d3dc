what you realize is your capacityto tap into dopamine as a motivator notjust seeking dopamine rewards that isinfinite and i i can say with with greatcertainty that this ishow you were able to build a big companyand sell it how you&amp;#39;ve been able tobuild a successful podcast and sell ithow you constantly seeking becauseseeking is the rewardandrew huberman welcome to the show manit&amp;#39;s great to be here i should say drandrew just just so people know whatthey&amp;#39;re what they&amp;#39;re about to get dudeit&amp;#39;s awesome to have you back our firstinterview completely melted my brainresearching you is one of my favoritethings to do the breadth of topics thatyou cover is incrediblenone more so than the fact that we canget to our mind through our body which ithink is one of the most incrediblethings before we started rolling thoughi had this whole interview planned iknew exactly where we were going to goand then you made a comment i wasbringing up bitcoin and uhcryptocurrency as i do because i&amp;#39;mobsessed and you said well there&amp;#39;s onlyone biological currency and that&amp;#39;sdopamine that&amp;#39;s right and i was likewell now i know where we&amp;#39;re startingwhat do you mean by that yeah so youknow human beings have evolved tons oftechnologiesand currenciesbitcoin ethereum are not topics i know alot a lot about but when you think aboutdollar euro bitcoin ethereum you thinkabout wins and lossesin sport in life in relationship andanything something in your brain andbody has to keep track of that did youwin did you lose what&amp;#39;s a letdown what&amp;#39;sa celebration andi think one of the most importantfindings in the last few years inneuroscience is thatwhile the molecule dopamine isassociated with rewardit&amp;#39;s more aboutmotivation and cravingthere&amp;#39;s a really classic experiment nowthat people use to demonstrate this taketwo ratsand the rats independently separatecages can lever pressfor fooduh when they can access foodthere&amp;#39;s a little bit of dopamine that&amp;#39;sreleased anytime they get some food sowe always thought that foodlike many other rewardslike food sex warmth when you&amp;#39;re coldcool when you&amp;#39;re too warmis triggering the release of dopaminebutsomeone had the good idea to depletedopamine in one of those animalsand then what you find is that theanimal withoutdopamine still enjoys foodstill enjoys other pleasures so dopamineis not really involved in the enjoymentof those pleasures it&amp;#39;s involved inmotivation because if you make theanimal have to move just one rat&amp;#39;slengthbelieve it or not to get to that leverthe animal with dopamine will work to goget that thing it will work through someeffort to go get the reward whereas theanimal or turns out the human withoutmuch dopaminecan still experience pleasure they cansit on their couch and cram their facewith pleasure inducing calories or whathave you watch pleasure-inducing thingson the television but they have verylittle motivation to go pursue thingsthat will deliver them pleasureso when i say dopamine is the universalcurrencyofeverything what i mean is it&amp;#39;s drivingthe motivation to develop new currencieswhen somebody can sit back and say uhi&amp;#39;ll just throw this number out let&amp;#39;ssay somebody has a hundred thousandbitcoins which presumably now is worthoh my godcertainly more than it was a few yearsagothe way they can register whether or notthey are in a position of wealth or nothas everything to do with the the numberthey see on the screen or in theirbitcoin walletbutthat number is converted into a chemicalsignal that has everything to do withhow much you had previously so so wecould talk about the so-called rewardprediction error how good you feel withan experience has everything to do withhow muchyou had previouslyand dopamine itself is what&amp;#39;s drivingthe human species tocreate these new technologies and sowhile we think of currencies as the goalit&amp;#39;s actually what&amp;#39;s really driven theforward evolution of our our species hasbeen the desire to go seek things beyondthe confines of our skin and when i saythe common currency is dopamine what imean is the molecule dopamine whensecreted in the brain makes us pursuethings build things create things makesus want new things that we don&amp;#39;tcurrently already have and so it has alot of dimensions to it but rather thanthink about dopamine as a signal forreward like a dopamine hit weclassically think to talk about it it&amp;#39;smore accurate really to think aboutdopamine as driving motivation andcraving to go seek rewards that&amp;#39;s therad experiment and it&amp;#39;s a way oftabulating where we are in our life arewe doing well or are we doing poorly andthat happens on very short time scaleslike do you wake up feeling good or doyou wake up feeling kind of loworon long time scales if you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough a long degree or you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough your life how are you doing howdo you gauge that well it has everythingto do with how much dopamine you werereleasing in the previous days and weeksand years so you&amp;#39;re always comparing andall of this is subconscious but what&amp;#39;scool is that once you make theseprocesses conscious once you understanda little bit about how dopamine isreleased and how it changes ourperspective and our behavior then youcan actually work with it so it&amp;#39;s one oftheum instances where knowledge ofknowledge actually turns out to be areally useful tooldude that&amp;#39;s crazy to me so one of thethings that i get hit up about all thetime ispeople feel stuckand as you like really push on them tofigure out why they feel stuck they&amp;#39;llbe like yeah i want to do that and but ijust you know i can&amp;#39;t get out of bed ori don&amp;#39;t have the energy to pursue it orwhatever andyou get into thiscommon thing that people say in mindsetand i really believe it but i find itfar more interesting when you&amp;#39;re talkingabout it from a neuro chemicalstandpoint which is you just don&amp;#39;t wantit badly enoughand when i think aboutmy own life i sometimes worrythat i&amp;#39;m either more malleable thanother people or that i have a greaterability to manipulate my dopaminerelease or whateverbecause i&amp;#39;m very good at building desireand i like the way that desire feels nowwhen you use the word hunger i thinkpeople get confused because i actuallydon&amp;#39;t enjoy being hungry for food i findthat totally unpleasurablehowever being hungry for sex i findincredibly i feel alive i feel focused ifeel energized i feel aggressive it&amp;#39;scomplex for sure but i find that feelingincred the the act of wanting somethingin the future in in that kind or inbusiness and trying to build somethingi&amp;#39;ve in fact that&amp;#39;s an interestinginsight into my own selfabouti like to buildanddo we know so we dopamine is theneurochemistry of the pursuit of makingsure that i have the energy to go but dowe know how we can spike thatwell first of all it&amp;#39;s clear to me basedon your description that you&amp;#39;ve tappedinto theseuh channels that release dopaminebecause craving and wanting whether ornot it&amp;#39;s sex or or uh money orconnectionor anything all right uh is that&amp;#39;s thethe primary trigger for dopamine releaseyeah now sex and reproduction makes themost sense from the perspective ofevolution uh i mean any species everyspecieshas tends to have two primary goals oneprotect it&amp;#39;s young and second make moreof itself usually in reverse order rightso even for people that don&amp;#39;t wantchildren i mean you might not or peopleof course not everyone is having sexjust to reproduce but at a primordiallevel that&amp;#39;s what those circuits arethere for so every species in particularmammalian species where there&amp;#39;s a lot ofparenting and caretakingof the youngtries to take make more of itself andeverything that you see like maternalaggression which is a powerful circuitthat gets activated afterfemales of any species in particularmammals give birth they will fight tothe death and they gain superhumanstrength in order to protect their youngthat&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a known circuit forthat in the brain that gets activatedonce a female has offspringand it&amp;#39;s robustinside tracker is offering our listeners25 off their entire store includinginner age 2.0 just visitinsidetracker.comimpact theory all right guys check outinside tracker today take care and belegendaryso interesting man like have you readthe book the female brain i have not ohmy god so i just probably lost a lot ofpoints but no no but you&amp;#39;re one it&amp;#39;ll besuper interesting because you&amp;#39;ll know ifshe&amp;#39;s on the right track from aneuroscience perspective i rememberreading the book at the time i thought iwas going to have kidsand i remember thinking whoa like thisbook chronicles what happens to awoman&amp;#39;s brain and how things change andi was like when you have kids man youare inviting aneurochemical change in your significantother that is going to play itself outin a very real way and i&amp;#39;d be lying if isaid that wasn&amp;#39;t one of the things oneof the many things but one of the thingsthat i factored into not having kidsinteresting uh and then the same withmenopause that it&amp;#39;s this really dramaticsort of reorganizing might not be theright word but that it it has realimplications in theway that the person moves just as thedecline of testosterone has in men wellin on aon the positive sideduring pregnancy the woman&amp;#39;s hippocampusher brain area associated with memoryand retention of information it goesthrough a period in which it gets worsefor certain types of information butthen achieves superior levels of workingmemory oncethe babies arrive because there are alot of things to manage so this makessense this is true in rodents this istrue in humans and then in terms of thebiology of the father we now know thatwhen because typically parents have uhyou know does seem like one spousealways does more than the otherbut even in the most evenly dividedhouseholdsthe there&amp;#39;s usually some co-parenting ofsome sort but that the father has abig increase in the hormone prolactinwhenthe mother is expecting and theprolactin lays down body fat it preparesfor sleepless nights for women it itsparks um the circuitry for milk letdownfor for nursingso the dad bod has a lot to do withprolactin this is true in in birds insmall mammals and in humans and this isnow there was a paper published innatureon humans specifically about this andwhen you think about the relationshipbetween dopamine and prolactin it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;sinteresting and it takes us back to thismotivation and craving that you weredescribing earlier which is thatdopamine and prolactin work in inopposite fashionso the the most salient example of thisis sex and reproduction whereanticipation of sex and reproductiongreatly increases dopaminebut postsreproductivepost-sex it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be forreproduction there&amp;#39;s a spark inprolactin in the mail that&amp;#39;s the spikeexcuse me in prolactin and that spike inprolactin is actually what sets therefractory period during which he can&amp;#39;tmate again so it sets a period ofquiescence to keepmen it&amp;#39;s repair bonding for the exchangeof chemicals through the nose to thethrough the skin and through the sweatmainly through odor uh we could talkabout pheromones if you want but that&amp;#39;sa topic that&amp;#39;s somewhat controversialthe actual identity of pheromones inhumans has not been identified but thereare pheromone effects in humanscontroversial in that people don&amp;#39;t agreewhat&amp;#39;s really happening well okay sothere&amp;#39;s this culture of biologists thathave clearly identifiedpheromone effects in other in non-humansand non-human primatesbut whether or not those arethe classic definition of a pheromoneeffect is that it&amp;#39;s subconscious thatyou can&amp;#39;t actually detect the smellhowever we know that smells themselvesconscious detection of them can evokevery robust physiological responses oneone example to just stay in this arenaof of of thought is that a guy by thename of gnome sobel who&amp;#39;s at theweizmann institute he used to be atberkeley he has a lab over in israel hisamazing lab works on olfactionsmell and they discovered that the scentof women&amp;#39;s tears causes a dramatic andsignificant reduction in testosterone inmen what absolutely and this waspublished if anyone wants to go look itup it was published in science magazineyou know you can smell tears yeah wehave you know the super bowl ofpublishing and science is science natureand self those are the three topjournals this is published in sciencemagazine very stringent uh the smell oftears now it&amp;#39;s subconscious at somelevelbut the other thing that if we weregoing to kind of play around in thishormones and behave interactions betweenhumans um there are some reallyinteresting examples so for instancemenwill rate the smell of a woman&amp;#39;s skin orsweat or the perception of her face asmore beautiful during the pre-ovulatoryphase of her menstrual cyclethat pre-ovulatory phase is associatedwith a number of different changes inhormones okayjust that smell will increasetestosterone in a maleoral contraception in the femalewomen taking oral contraception itadjusts their hormones such that men nolonger detect this change inhow attractive women are doesn&amp;#39;t meanthey find them unattractive but it meansthey don&amp;#39;t find them increasinglyinteractive during this certain periodof the of their of their menstrual cycleso we are constantly signaling back andforth through hormones in fact we metover thereand shook hands because we&amp;#39;ve beentested for covet and the rest we shookhands andwhat happened and what happens within 30seconds of any human being contactingone another is they shake hands and thenthey wipe their the chemicals of theother person on their facegnome&amp;#39;s lab has also shown this and sowe are constantly signaling throughthrough chemical exchange sometimes it&amp;#39;ssubconscious and those are the so-calledpheromone effects sometimes it&amp;#39;s lowlevels of odors that are beneath ourconscious detection and sometimes it&amp;#39;soutright wow this person smells reallyreally good or they look particularlygood today oftentimes that&amp;#39;s tied to theof the period in which they areovulating in their menstrual cycle so iwant to plant a flag here about all thethings that we dothat aremessing with these mechanisms likecologne or deodorant or oralcontraception of which i&amp;#39;m not saying ispornography like all interception hasserved a great role in it for certainpeople some people might say was this anethical discussion or is it good is itbad but um either way it is having aneffect right so to remove i only look atthings through the lens of biology notthrough the lens of of whether or not weshould or shouldn&amp;#39;t do things i love itokay so we&amp;#39;re planning that we&amp;#39;re comingback to it but now i want to get to howdo we spike intentionally you&amp;#39;ve talkedabout we can spike testosterone but iwant to know can we spike dopamineyeah so um and you&amp;#39;ve done this so yourexample ofcraving isactually what you crave you crave thefeeling of craving is beautiful becauseit would what it means is that you don&amp;#39;tallow yourself to go so far down the arcof the dopamine trajectory to get to theother source of motivation so there aretwo sources of motivation as it relatesto dopamine and then we can think abouttools that we could export from thesethat are nested in neurobiologythe first is to do what you dowhich is to be able to sense the cravingas its own form of pleasure this haskind of remnants of carol dweck&amp;#39;s growthmindset that you eventually develop apleasure in the seeking and the strivinghas you know uh has flavors of a davidgoggins type approach where where itseems like he gets pleasure from thefriction itself and so there areelements of that you seem to have thatas wellbutif you can start to identify the cravingas its own internally released drug thisthing dopamine that is a source ofmotivation then what you realize is thatcapturing the reward is wonderfulbut attaching dopamine to the reward isactually a little bit dangerousattaching yeah this is celebrating thewin celebrating the win more than thepursuit it actually sets you up forfailure in the future and so this getsus right into something called dopaminereward prediction error and rewardprediction error is basically if youexpect something to be really greatand then it&amp;#39;s not quite that great yourdopamine baseline lowers and nowunderstanding what we know aboutdopamine that means that not only didyou you feel as if you lost because itwasn&amp;#39;t as much a celebration as youthought it would be but it also meansthat you&amp;#39;re starting from a lower placemeaning you are less motivated now thesimpler way to conceptualize this ishave a colleague at stanford she runsthe addiction dual diagnosis clinic atuh her name is dr anna lemke she has abook called dopamine nation that&amp;#39;s outright nowand she&amp;#39;s really described as pleasurepain balance where anytime you have abunch of dopamine and you&amp;#39;re in pursuitpursuit pursuitafter you achieve a win now this couldbe a business win a relationship a winof any kindbutinevitably there&amp;#39;s going to be a tippingback of the scale on the pain side andthat pain side is always going to go alittle bit higher than the dopamine sideso this is what you would feel if youpursued a goal like building a bigcompanyhere it comes here comes the big saleand then there&amp;#39;s the well what now thekind of letdown now if you wait if yousimply wait and stop pursuing dopaminefor a short while the scale starts toresetthe problem is a lot of peopleimmediately roll right into the nextpursuitand then what happens is that scalestarts to get stuck on the pain side alittle bit more a little bit more alittle bit more and pretty soon noamount of seeking will allow you toexperience that craving and motivationso what what does this mean in terms ofan actual tool well first of allif people can do what you do they&amp;#39;regoing to be in a much better position inlife it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s schoolsport relationship any domain of life ifyou can start to register ah thatcraving and that friction and thatdesire that almost kind of low level ofagitation sometimes high level ofagitation that is that i&amp;#39;m trying toimpose my will on the world in abenevolent way we hopethat&amp;#39;s dopamine it&amp;#39;s working with itsclose cousin which is epinephrine whichis adrenaline they are very closecousins in fact dopamine manufacturesepinephrine a lot of people don&amp;#39;t knowthis but adrenaline is actually madefrom the molecule dopamineokay so those two are hanging outtogether it&amp;#39;s like crave work crave workcraving work craving work craving workand then you get the winand some peopleallow the big peak in dopamine to beassociated with the winandsmart peoplelearn to adjust their celebrationinternally right this is all internalyou could throw the biggest party in theworld but as long as you&amp;#39;re kind of inlaid backandlooking at this not letting yourself getmanic crazyyou won&amp;#39;t necessarily crash as hardand pretty soon your system will resetso you take the day you clean up thedishes you relax you go what now i&amp;#39;mfeeling a little low well rather thangoing out and spiking your dopamineagain just wait understand that thescale will reset again give yourself afew days where you&amp;#39;re going to feel alittle kind of underwhelmed thingsaren&amp;#39;t going to be as interestingit&amp;#39;s going to be hard to trigger thatbig release because you just hadthe peakwell if you adjust that you relax youunderstand there&amp;#39;s always a little bitof a postpartum depressionwe sometimes hear about postpartumdepression that&amp;#39;s a clinical thing butthere&amp;#39;s always that kind of today&amp;#39;s notas excitingas the previous days what am i going todo with my life but thenif you let it start ratcheting up againthen what you realize is your capacityto tap into dopamine as a motivator notjust seeking dopamine rewards that isinfinite and i i can say with with greatcertainty that this ishow you were able to build a big companyand sell it how you&amp;#39;ve been able tobuild a successful podcast and sell ithow you constantly seeking becauseseeking is the reward and i think formost people we think of the reward asthe finish line and so the key is to getto the finish line step into the endzone but no end zone dance it&amp;#39;s justlike yep and now i&amp;#39;m gonna go do itagainthat&amp;#39;s really the key that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s thekey to doing it over and over and when isee big athletes oracademics or anyone or musicians andtheyrise and crashit&amp;#39;s clear they&amp;#39;ve lost the touch withthe motivation evoked dopamine andthey&amp;#39;ve lost touch probably because ithasn&amp;#39;t really been described by theneuroscience community until anna hasstarted talking about this stuffpublicly and i&amp;#39;m just kind of echoingwhat she&amp;#39;s beautifully saidsaid much better than i am which is thatyou should always expect that after abunch of pleasure there&amp;#39;s going to bethat low and then that craving how do iget back to there again and the key isyou have to walk the staircase again youdon&amp;#39;t get to do this as a square wavepull you know you don&amp;#39;t get to justascend ascend ascend it&amp;#39;s always updownup a little bit higher down up you knowit&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the functionso um i don&amp;#39;t know if that resonateswith your experience i&amp;#39;m over herefreaking out so you&amp;#39;ve literally justexplained what i will say is the singlemost important loop if you want to besuccessfuland you used wordsattach right you had another one whichwas about your t i forget the exact wordbut you&amp;#39;re taking you&amp;#39;re insertingyourself consciously into the processbecause what i learned very early on andi&amp;#39;m so grateful in the same way that youare grateful that your upbringing wasn&amp;#39;tperfect but it ended up giving you aframe of reference and insights thathave propelled you forward i&amp;#39;m verygrateful that i spent a decade justtrying to get rich that was the statedmission i would say it every day likei&amp;#39;m here to get rich i show up to workto get rich it&amp;#39;s about getting rich richrich rich and it didn&amp;#39;t workand so and my wife pulls me aside andshe&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re now damaging themarriage like you&amp;#39;re just so fiendishlyfocused on the goalthat there&amp;#39;s nothing as integrated inyour life you&amp;#39;re doing something youhate for an end state that may nevercomeand that was so profound and it shook meso deeply and it suddenly became clearthat from a neurological perspectivewhat i wanted was to feel alive and oncei put everything in the pursuit i&amp;#39;m justinterested in can i show up every dayand sincerely pursue this thing which imay never get but i&amp;#39;m gonna honor myselfcelebrate myself big up myself as thebrits would say for just showing uptoday and actually trying to make ithappenand one that&amp;#39;s way more sustainable andthen two you don&amp;#39;tyou don&amp;#39;t get tricked into thinking thatoh when i get this thing that i&amp;#39;ll feelgood because it&amp;#39;s the craving that makesme feel alive so it&amp;#39;s the state ofwanting that is in and of itself thepleasurable act that&amp;#39;s right and soi began to use the metaphor of i&amp;#39;m gonnaclimb this mountain only to want thenext mountain to climb and once i knewthat well then you have to be totallycomfortable dropping back down andstarting all over now the interestingthing and i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m foolingmyself or if i haveso integrated that trickbut the come down isn&amp;#39;t hard for me soi i think my last day at quest was amondayand tuesday i started impact theory andso that went from i had 3 000 employeesyour position matters you get a lot ofdeference uh you&amp;#39;ve got a privilegedparking space you know what i mean likethere&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that gointo it andbut i didn&amp;#39;t none of like my rewardsystem was tied to that so it was veryeasy for me to start the next day withthere was only seven of us and no onehad time for any deference of any kindand i went from having an ea which youcan&amp;#39;t imagine how amazing that is to notand you&amp;#39;re doing everything for yourselfagainbut that wasn&amp;#39;t a painful thing becausei was so focused on all right cool thisis step one again and now can can werepeat well it helps if you can expectthat there will be a little bit of a dippost win or postwhatever um that&amp;#39;s helpful there&amp;#39;salways a refractory period of any kindso to speak if you expect it that&amp;#39;sgreat because you eliminate the thedownside of the reward prediction errorreward prediction error can also beconceptualized as i tell you we&amp;#39;re goingto go this restaurant i keep building upthe food building up the food i actuallyraised the expectation and therequirement that that food be reallyspectacular better off i just tell youit&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty good and thenyou&amp;#39;re wowed by it right because if yourdopamine was higher in anticipation thanthe actual food evoked well then itmakes sense why would you&amp;#39;re alwaysintegrating over the dopamine releaseyou had previouslynow there are a couple things that yousaid in there that i want to highlightwhich i find so interesting uh and wecan get a little biteastern philosophy mystical here but tieit back to some real neuroscience whichis you said you know that&amp;#39;s the juicethe motivation is the juice you knowthatif you look at eastern philosophy andthey talk about qi you know in this youknow what is that i i wager that isdopamine the desire to pursue things andto create more of oneself andas a species whether or not you decideto have kids or not those circuits alluse the one universal currency dopamineof wanting more things that are outsidethe confines of your skin and that&amp;#39;swhat&amp;#39;s driven forward evolution ofindividuals andfamilies and cultures and our ourspecies as a whole and again thecircuitry has been there for many manytens if not hundreds of thousands ofyearsand so it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s highly conservedand so what that means is that itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s bitcoin orethereum it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;sputting rockets on other planets itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s building thefirst automobile it&amp;#39;s the same currencyso understanding those cycles is reallykey the other thing is the element ofpain i think that understanding thatpain and pleasure and this reallydynamic balancecan also help us which in the followingwayany pain that you feel the longer daythe less sleep the the kind of agonythat things aren&amp;#39;t working that poweroutlet doesn&amp;#39;t work or the internet isslow whatever it isthe amount of pleasure that you willeventually experienceis directly relation related excuse meto how much pain you experience so weknow this from actually what nowadayswould be considered quite barbaric andunethical experiments where they wouldgive people electrical shocksand they would measure their responseand then they&amp;#39;d say we&amp;#39;re going toincrease it we&amp;#39;re going to increase iteventually they get to the point where aslight shock that was previously verypainful actually evokes a sense ofpleasurenow you couldn&amp;#39;t do these experimentsanymore these are not the experiments ido in my labthese are older experiments butfor instance and this has been discussedin scientific research papers uh givingsomebody a like a 10-minute ice bath forinstance or even a three-minute ice bathor a one-minute ice bath it&amp;#39;s quitepainful but there was a study from theuniversity of prague uh european journalphysiology showed that after a painfulice bath stimulusthe amount of dopamine release goes upfor two and a half hours to 250 percentabove baseline and that&amp;#39;s not becausethe ice bathitself evokes dopamine release a lot ofpeople think oh cold water of oxdopamine release no pain evokes dopaminerelease after the pain is over yesterdayi tweaked my back because i do thisstupid thing every few years the samestupid thing and it&amp;#39;s really painful andthen you just remember all the ways inwhich you can&amp;#39;t move around i was likestanding up this morning like ah andjust walking is so painful as the painhas started to dissipate you get alittle bit of a high right you get alittle bit of a euphoria that&amp;#39;s dopaminebecause of the the degree of pain youexperienced previously predicts how muchpleasure so when you start a companydown in the dregs and you&amp;#39;re shovelingagainthat&amp;#39;s beautiful because that means thatthe wind that you achieveis going to be as good or greater thanthe one you had previously in your casewith quest and so we go back to thisexample the person that&amp;#39;s not motivatedthat can&amp;#39;t get off the couch thatdoesn&amp;#39;t want to do anything well this isthe problem we remember the radexperiment they are effectively the ratwith no dopamine but they can stillachievesome sense of pleasureby consuming excess calories byconsuming social media and look i&amp;#39;m notjudging i do this stuff too rightscrolling social media if you&amp;#39;ve everscrolled social media and you&amp;#39;re like idon&amp;#39;t even know why i&amp;#39;m doing this itdoesn&amp;#39;t really feel that goodand i can remember a time where you&amp;#39;dsee something it was just so cool or yousee something online i remember thiswhen ted talks first came out i was likethis is amazing these are some at leastsome of them are really smart peoplesharing really cool insights and thennow that they&amp;#39;re like a gazillion tedtalks i remember spending a winter in myoffice at when i was a junior professorcleaning my office finallyand binging ted talks in the backgroundthinking this is a good use of my timepretty soon they all sucked to me i waslike this isn&amp;#39;t good so what you need todo is stop watching dead docs for awhilewait and then they become interestingagain and that&amp;#39;s this pain pleasurebalanceand so for people that aren&amp;#39;t feelingmotivated the problem is they&amp;#39;re notmotivated but they&amp;#39;re getting justenough or excess sustenance so they&amp;#39;regetting the little mild hits of opioidit becomes an opioid system and if youthink about the opioid drugs as opposedto dopamine dopaminergic drugsdopaminergic drugs make people rabid foreverything you know drugs of abuse likecocaine amphetamine make peopleincredibly outward directed or theyhardly notice anything except what theywant more of more more it&amp;#39;s veryit&amp;#39;s badbecause those drugs trigger so muchdopamine release that they become thereward it&amp;#39;s very circular that only thedrug can give that much dopamine nothingthey could pursue would give them asmuch dopamine as the drug itselfso there&amp;#39;s that and then there&amp;#39;s thekind of opioid like effectsof constantly indulging oneself withsocial media or with video games or withwith food or with anything to the pointwhere it no longer evokes the motivationand craving and this is really the newevolution of the understanding ofdopamine and neuro in neuroscience whichis that dopamine itself is not thereward it&amp;#39;s the build-up to the rewardand the reward has more of a kind ofopioid bliss-like property which itselfis not bad if it&amp;#39;s endogenous releasedfrom within but when we can just sitthere like the like the rat with nodopamine gorging ourselves withpleasures so to speak what you end upwith is somebody that feels reallyunmotivated and those pleasures nolonger work to tickle those feel-goodcircuits and so there&amp;#39;s no reason forthem to go out and pursue anything andthat&amp;#39;s a pretty dark picture so the thekeys areto pursue rewards but understand thatthe pursuit is actually the rewardif you want to have repeatedwins okay you the celebration has to beless than the pursuit and that&amp;#39;s hardfor some people to dothey you know they it&amp;#39;s got to be thatyour celebration is slightly lessdopaminergicit can be very reflective you can be ingratitude those are otherneurotransmitter systems but you don&amp;#39;twant to be on that high as you celebratethe windyou want to betrickling out your dopamineregularly until you pursue things andthen just understand there will alwaysbe a crash of pain and the more pain youexperience the more dopamine you canachieve if you get back on the avenue ofperfect yeah this gets into unintendedconsequences of modernity and so we&amp;#39;reliving through this time where we youknow going back to that flag that weplanted of these unintended consequencesof oh i can make myself smell good oh ican you know watch the coolest video ohlike tick tockdude i don&amp;#39;t have an addictivepersonality that&amp;#39;s the first thing wherei&amp;#39;ll lose an hour and be like what the[ __ ] did i just do well that&amp;#39;sthe problem is not pleasures the problemis that pleasure experienced withoutprior requirement for pursuit yesisterrible for us it&amp;#39;s terrible for us asindividuals it&amp;#39;s terrible for us as asgroups and i have great confidence inthe human species to work this out butwe are finding now and we are going toincreasingly find that those who will besuccessful young or old are going to bethose people who can create their owninternal buffers they&amp;#39;re going to beable to control their relationship topleasures because the proximity topleasures and their availability is theproblem if you look atthe increase inuse of drugs of abuse or prescriptionmedication which at least at the firstpass deliver pleasure pain relief thewhole issue with the opioid crisis andand dopaminergic drugs like ritalinadderallyou know there is sometimes there&amp;#39;s aclinical need but tons of people aretaking those recreationally now or tostudy huge dopamine increases are whatthose causethat is a problem that&amp;#39;s a seriousproblem because it creates a cycle whereyou you need more of that specific thingi always say addictionis a progressive narrowing of the thingsthat bring you pleasure that&amp;#39;s such agood difference and you know and i don&amp;#39;tlike to comment too much onenlightenment because you know i don&amp;#39;treally know what that is as aneurobiologist but a good life we couldsay is a progressive expansion of thethings that bring you pleasure and evenbetter is a good life is a progressiveexpansion of the things that bring youpleasure and includes pleasure throughmotivation and hard work andunderstanding this pain pleasure balancewhereby if you experience pain and youcan continue to be in that friction andexert effortthe rewards are that much greater whenthey arriveand soi think that if you look at any drug ofabuse or any situation where somebodyisn&amp;#39;t motivated or thinks that now theymay have clinically diagnosed attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder but a lotof what people think is adhd it turnsout is people just over consumingdopamine from various sources and thenand also the context within a tick tockfeed is the context switch is insane thebrain has never seen first of allthere&amp;#39;s a first time in human evolutionthat we wrote with our thumbs but that&amp;#39;sa pretty benign shift and that the othershift isnormally you walk from one room toanother or from a field into the treesor from a hut into or a house orwhatever it is but now you can get 10000 context switches in that 30 minutesof scrolling on instagram or to talk andso it&amp;#39;s all about self-regulation we aregoing to select for the people that canself-regulate andso then people say well how do youself-regulate how do kids self-regulatewell this is my hope and one of thereasons i&amp;#39;ve gotten excited about publiceducation and teaching neuroscience isthatthis is a place where knowledge ofknowledge actually can allow oneself tointervene when you think i&amp;#39;m feeling lowi don&amp;#39;t feel good nothing really feelslike am i depressed maybe but maybeyou&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;ve saturated thedopamine circuits you&amp;#39;re now in the painpart of things what do you do well youhave to stop you need you need toreplenish dopamine you need to stopengaging with this behavior and thenyour pleasure for it will come back butyou have to constantly control the hingeit&amp;#39;s not just about being back and forthon the seesaw you have to make sure thehinge doesn&amp;#39;t get stuck in pain or inpleasure so it&amp;#39;s a dynamic process beinga human being it&amp;#39;s not easy and rememberthese circuits didn&amp;#39;t evolve for thispurposethey evolve primarily formaking more of ourselves that&amp;#39;s whythey&amp;#39;re so closely tied to thereproductive circuits and that&amp;#39;s why itwas interesting and very relevant thatyou said that yourdesire to have sex with your wife is oneof the most powerful feelings and itkind of as a from a neurochemicalperspective it wicks out into all theseother pursuits right those otherpursuits aren&amp;#39;t about sex per se butit&amp;#39;s the same molecules so the feelingis the same it&amp;#39;s just that some peoplefor some people the amplitude of thatdopamine signal for craving sex is veryhigh for some people that&amp;#39;s lower andit&amp;#39;s higher for um video games you knowwhatever you lean intoand and youthink about oftenin these pursuits we&amp;#39;ll start to reshapethese circuits because thesedopaminergic circuits are tied toeverything you know there are examplesof people getting addicted to the mostincredible things they&amp;#39;re also examplesof people getting very good but notaddicted to chess for instance it&amp;#39;s allthe samegeneral set of mechanismsyeah you talked earlier aboutthe the knowledge of knowledge and thatwas the big breakthrough for me at thedarkest period of my life i happened tograb a book we talked about this brieflyin our first interview i happened tograb a book that talked aboutneuroplasticity and they werehypothesizing maybe this is a thingandthatgave me hope because i could imaginewhat was going on in my brain and once ican visualize it then i feel like i caninsert myself into it it&amp;#39;s why i&amp;#39;vegotten so interested in health why i&amp;#39;mso interested in neuroscienceis for me if i were sliding towardsdepression i would do exactly whatyou&amp;#39;re saying i would assess that and belike okay wait a second i know that ican insert conscious control i know thatthis is abiological experience and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;mobsessed with that idea that you&amp;#39;rehaving a biological experience and to melike there&amp;#39;s some people that see theway the magic trick is done and it losesthe magic then for other people it&amp;#39;slike you see that it&amp;#39;s this is somebodythat&amp;#39;s spent 30 000 hours learning howto move their hands so that you don&amp;#39;tnotice that they just move the coin youknow from this hand to this hand it&amp;#39;sit blows me away i love magic uh beforethe pandemic a friend took me up to themagic castle here in hollywood andthere&amp;#39;s some incredible stuff going onmagic is actually really cool we coulduh just as a from a neuroscienceperspective magic it&amp;#39;s all aboutcreating gaps in your perception that&amp;#39;sobvious rightand when that happens because the thebrain is so accustomed to the laws ofphysics like objects fall down not upetc when that happens it clearlytriggers the surprise circuitry and thatitself that feeling of delight andsurprise is absolutely tied also tothese dopamine dopamine circuits it&amp;#39;sinteresting though that that doesn&amp;#39;tsend us into like terror like the peopledepends on the magic trick when i wentthere there was this crazy trick thatthe guy did he took out cards and i wasinvited up to sit next to him i signedmy name on a cardi took the card i took the cardi tore it up i put it in my pocketand at the end of the show we wentthrough a series of things at the end ofthe show hetook off his shoe and presented the cardto me with the signature intact and thecard intact and that was my signatureso he clearly created gaps of perceptionum but at some point as adults so ithink as long as we know the context isright then we can we can do this onething about dopamine that i just want tomake sure iuh mention and it based on something yousaid earlier is thatone interesting question about the brainis just asking the question you know howdo we segment time how do we how do youknow that this podcast has obviously hasa beginning in the middle and an end butyou know how do we segment time and sothere have been some beautifulexperiments done recently showing thatuh for instance if you&amp;#39;re watching asports game regardless of whether or notyour team scores like let&amp;#39;s saybasketball goes down court let&amp;#39;s saythey missed the three-pointer and thenyou know it&amp;#39;s a close game there&amp;#39;s alittle blip of dopamine that says thatwas one segment of timeand so dopamine is a big way in which wesegment time the other way are blinksbelieve it or notyeah that every time we blink there&amp;#39;s apaper publishing current biology everytime we blink we reset our perception ofthat when i understand more i guess thanthe dopamine why would dopamine beinvolved in time perfect question turnsout that the frequency of blinking isset by the level baseline level ofdopamine in the brain yes so when peopleare wide-eyed with excitement andthey&amp;#39;re and they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re notblinking very often or someone is on adrug that kicks out a lot of dopaminethey hardly ever blink their pupils arehugethey&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re actually not segmentingtime in the normal fashionand so much of your life in retrospectis segmented by those peaks and dopaminethey those mark key events in your lifewhen you met your wife uh that theirtheirall the segments of your life are arenoted by peaks and dopamine or the waythat you happen to conceptualizedopamine and so also people who aredepressed are often very focused on thepast they ruin naturally they default toruminating on the past when you adjustpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine levels to healthylevels they start becoming more forwardthinking and more present and so there&amp;#39;sthis relationship between blinking andtime perception dopamine and blinkinghow you conceptualize time has a lot todo with these peaks and dopamine andwhen they occurand this is a big deal because we&amp;#39;re youknow 2020 was a rough year for mostpeople 2021&amp;#39;s feeling a little betterbut we don&amp;#39;t really know where we are inthis whole arc of everything that&amp;#39;shappeningthere&amp;#39;s a lot of uncertainty yeahthe dopamine peaks and the frequency ofthose dopamine peaks have everything todo with how we carve up our experienceof time and anyone who spent a lot oftime in deep meditationstarts to develop a kind of intuitiveinternal representation of the fact thattime is very fluid in this way when wesay time is fluid what we mean is thesecretion of dopamine and these pulsesis very fluid they are under control ofour of what&amp;#39;s happening externally butalso how you conceptualize your lifelike where are you in your life are youyou know hopefully we&amp;#39;ll if davidsinclair has his way and hopefully hewill we will all live to be you knowmore than a hundred years oldhopefully in good vitality so this isthe more esoteric aspect of dopaminereal fast before we go about the timething yeah let me ask you so there was aperiod in my life i&amp;#39;ll take it at abouttwo years where for whatever reason i itcould have been six hours since i lastlooked at a clock i would be withinthree minutes of what time it was and mywife found it hilarious and so she&amp;#39;d belike what time is it and i&amp;#39;m like ohit&amp;#39;s 4 58.it was so weird that it like made myradar is like oh my god i have like thisspecial power and then it went awayand now i can probably get you within 15minutes but like uh it was really eerieis is there does that make a predictionor a round likea consistency of dopamine release orsomething yeah you nailed it it&amp;#39;s theconsistency that&amp;#39;s an internal it&amp;#39;s aninterval timer as we say so whenpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine is low they tend tooverestimate okay okayand when people&amp;#39;s dopamine is high theytend to underestimate time now it istrue that dopamine when it&amp;#39;s released isa little bit of a stimulant in thesystem because of the way it works withepinephrine how finely you slice time isvery dependent on dopamine and yourinternal level of autonomic arousal areally good example would be you&amp;#39;rereally excited about something or you&amp;#39;rereally stressed about something doesn&amp;#39;tmatter dopamine iselevated in excitement butnorepinephrine epinephrine tend to beelevated any time we&amp;#39;re agitated or orexcitedjust imagine you need to catch a flightyou&amp;#39;re in line at the security and theperson in front of you seems likethey&amp;#39;re going really really slowly yourframe rate is faster you&amp;#39;re just carvingup time more finely people are in caraccidents and then they reporteverything being in slow motion yourframe rate is issmaller you&amp;#39;re essentially gettingyou&amp;#39;re taking larger time bins and thisis why let&amp;#39;s say you wake up and you&amp;#39;rereally tired or you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re kindof out of it and you look and it&amp;#39;s liketext messages and emails and all thisstuff the world seems like it&amp;#39;s going byreally really fastdopamine is what is the diagno is thedynamic process by dopamine release ishould say is the dynamic process bywhich you adjust time perception so ifyou had a very keen perception of thepassage of time right down to the minuteor so that suggests very regularintervals of dopamine release and that&amp;#39;sprobably tied to outside events that arebelow your conscious awarenessbutuh dopamine releases i i sort ofnot to make this uh pg-13 or r-rated butif we go back to the example of sex sexand sleep are the two times when spaceand time have a very fluid typerelationship it&amp;#39;s veryhard to conceive space and time in sleepthat&amp;#39;s actually the nature of sleep iswe do the long blink no joke we closethe shutters stop bringing in externalinformation and in sleep space and timeare veryfluid right things can happen very fastor very slow slow motion you can beflying it there&amp;#39;s a lot of you know someof it is dreaming but space and time arevery fluid in wakefulnessspace and time are very anchored byphysical events in the world but ourperception of those is dynamicallyregulated by how much dopamine is in oursystem so it&amp;#39;s beginning to sound likedopamine does everything but it&amp;#39;s reallyassociated with motivation craving andtime interval keeping and so i would bewilling to bet that your pulses ofdopamine were very regular just likedropsso interesting so we do a lot of thingswho knows what i was doing at thatperiod if it had to do anything justthat i&amp;#39;m getting older and so it startsto disrupt itself who knows butwhat are some things so one thing i&amp;#39;veheard you talk about which i find reallyinterestingwhen i think about all the things thatwe&amp;#39;re doing that are disrupting thingsall these unintended consequences ofmodern behaviori am truly glad thatcell phones the internet and pornographydid not exist when i was younger becausei don&amp;#39;t know if at 14i could have been disciplined enough ifi had access to that andwhat like when you think about thethings that we&amp;#39;re doing right now thatare sort of the that have maybe the mostgrand unintended consequences where doyou landyeah on the time scale of 24 hours oneof the the huge mistakes that we allmake and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;ve said this many timesso if people have heard me say thisbefore forgive me but it turns out it&amp;#39;sstill trueuhgetting too much bright light exposurefrom the hours of 10 pm until 4 amunless you have to work shift work whichis a unique casethat bright light exposure between 10 pmand 4 am even if youadjust the colors of the lights youstill need to get everything reallyreally dim because it actuallyblocks the release of dopamine through apathway that involves a structure calledthe habenulathe habenula was a kind of crypticstructure in the brain for a long timebut now we know there&amp;#39;s a punishmentsignal in the brain you getneurochemically punishedfor viewing bright light at those hourshow how would that be wired in we&amp;#39;dnever be able to expose ourselves tobright light ah so that&amp;#39;s a greatquestion so firelight won&amp;#39;t do thatmoonlight&amp;#39;s fine candles lights that aredim are now in your environmentso the the pathway to the habenula andthen to these dopamine reducing circuitsare the pain pathway that we&amp;#39;rereferring to earlier it&amp;#39;s a genericpathway through which lots of differenttypes of signals and stimuli and eventscan punish us internally this is so gooddude and so i&amp;#39;m going to call this therich kid effectlike there and you mentioned hard workearlier there is a reason i think thatchildren of wealthy parents end upimploding because there is a anevolutionary the punishment pathwayevolutionary thing that&amp;#39;s going on thatsays you didn&amp;#39;t have to work hard forthe things that you own and because fromuh i need you to go hunt and gather andface a saber-toothed tiger i have toreward you for doing hard things andpunish you for not doing hard thingswell andyou know in the case of the thethe generic model of the of the spoiledrich kid it they actually can&amp;#39;t accessdopamine uh remember that that a moviefrom the 80s it was a uh it was calledlike the toy or something with richard iwas like if this [ __ ] says toyi&amp;#39;m gonna have a seizure yesrichard pryor in that movie and the kidhas everything and he&amp;#39;s the he&amp;#39;s theepitome of the spoiled brat all the toysall the cars all the things now we seethis with people who actually go fromrags to riches and then bathe in alltheir the luxuries they didn&amp;#39;t have as achild these are often the athletes thatdon&amp;#39;t go on to perform well againthese are people that crash because ofother dopamine-seeking behaviors youknow i&amp;#39;m not going to call out names butthere are far too many examples of theseand i don&amp;#39;t call out names mostlybecause we are all capable of this weall would like to think that oh if i hadall that money or if i had all thatsuccess i would really be a good humanbeing and i wouldn&amp;#39;t do those thingsanyone any human being that is immersedin these dopamine circuits too much orwho gets too much pleasure withouthaving to pursue it first and reallywork andactually experience pain pleasureratcheting back and forth along thatclimb because it wasn&amp;#39;t just dopaminelike this for you it&amp;#39;s probably painpleasure pain pleasure painpleasure pain right they&amp;#39;re alwaysproportional to one anotherso anyone that does that it has atremendously hard time accessingpleasurethey can&amp;#39;t do that and and we oftenthink about the extremes of addictionand those are really severe but we alsohave to think about the more subtleforms of something we really love butindulging in it just a little too oftenso that it no longer has that edgeyou know there have been really goodstudies of people who jump out ofairplanes with parachutes you knowi&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun it looks likea thrill but people do over and over andover againoften diedoing other things they often becomedrug addicts because it&amp;#39;s a huge high ohyeah yeah a lot of thatand you know there are a lot of examplesof this i mean you can get addicted toanything the key is to regulate thatbehavior so you asked whatyou know what should people do wellcertainlyi&amp;#39;m trying this now and i have some goodexamples some young people i know andwork with are taking breaks from notjust social media but no cell phonewhatsoever i&amp;#39;m actually trying an oddexperiment which isfor the first hour of every day no phonemostly because part of your 25 no-gosyesright so we have circuitry in the brainrelated to the so-called basal gangliaand we have go sort of activating youknow think gas pedal and then we there&amp;#39;sa lot of no go circuitryandlearning how to keep that no go don&amp;#39;tcircuitry as we could call ituh tuned up is very important and somany times throughout the day but i tryand get 25 a day where i activelyrefrain from doing something that iimpulsively want to do could be lookingat my phone but it could even besomething trivial like i want to walk tothe kitchen and get a glass of water soi&amp;#39;m actively engaging inself-denin denial not cognitive denial probablythat too but how would i know um but inaction-based denial so restricting mybehavior in some way as a way of keepingthese dopamine circuits tuned up alsonot looking at my phone first thing inthe morning for an hour becauseknowing what we now know about thesecond phase of sleep and rem sleepbeing more predominant the second waveof sleep and the fact that you&amp;#39;reworking through a lot of emotional andlogistical contingencies you&amp;#39;rereshaping your brain in sleep that&amp;#39;swhen neuroplasticity occurs during sleepit&amp;#39;s triggered in wakefulness but itactually takes place in sleep especiallythat second half of sleepwhen you wake up in the morning you arein a perfect position to what i callreceive the download of all the workthat your neural circuitry has beendoing the night before but if youimmediately go to a sensory experienceespecially a rich sensory experience ofstuff scrolling by you&amp;#39;re actuallymissing the information that youprocessed at night and even moreimportantly that second half of thenight during rem sleep is when theemotional weight of things start becomeslet&amp;#39;s sayyou put it on the shelf properly thingsthat are important to emotionalemotionally registered get put in oneshelf things that were like the commentyou got on twitter that was triggeringdoesn&amp;#39;t seem like such a big deal aftera good night&amp;#39;s sleep and that&amp;#39;s becausethat second half of sleep is actuallywhen you re-experience these things butyour body can&amp;#39;t secrete adrenaline it&amp;#39;skind of an internal form of therapy oreven trauma therapy and that&amp;#39;s whypeople who don&amp;#39;t get that sleep are veryyou know they&amp;#39;re easily agitated theyfeel like the world is crushing down onthem so when i wake up in the morning iwant to receive ideas that i want tolearn from my learning and if you takein new information you are not in aposition to do that and 60 minutes is atough one so i give myself two no-gosfor the 60-minute block if i can do itand i&amp;#39;ll tell you a lot of mornings ifail tom i don&amp;#39;t do it interesting ijust i found that shocking but i heardyou say that in another interview and iwas like well i mean i&amp;#39;m human you knowthere are mornings whereum i get enticed or worseworse i find myself reflexively pickingup without having made the consciousdecision and that&amp;#39;s wheni realized thatyou know we are alldeep in this process and i thinkuh we have to regulate it the theexperiment i&amp;#39;d like to do maybe you&amp;#39;lldo this with me as a challenge becausethe challenge is always good is in thenew year i actually want to take everyodd waking hour of the day off the phoneso even hours of the dayas long as it&amp;#39;s waking i&amp;#39;m willing tohave it on and work with it but oddhours just turn it off no matter whati don&amp;#39;t know if this will destroy mostof the relationshipsbut just to see can i do it on a rigidlyexternally imposed schedule because ifyou think about most of the growth inlife comes from these rigidly externallyimposed schedules and we hate thembut they are where we learn restraintdude this is so important i don&amp;#39;t knowif i hate them anymore so people willoften ask like how i do this that or theother whatever it is like tom how do youumso i work 93 hours a week that&amp;#39;s like myaverage that&amp;#39;s your average sotom why do you work 93 hours every weekand the answer is because 93 are joyfuland 94 wouldn&amp;#39;tandwhen i start working more than that itusually means that i&amp;#39;m juggling so manythings that my brain seems to be usingsleep as a way to track some of them orsomething yeah so i find myself wakingup a lot no i have a trick that allowsme to fall back asleep very fast butit&amp;#39;s still not as restful as justsleeping through the night what&amp;#39;s thetrick if you don&amp;#39;t mind me entering idon&amp;#39;t at all so i have two pairs ofairpod headphonesand i put them inand i put them on a uhfiction book and i turn the volume downsuch that if i don&amp;#39;t put a little bit ofpressure on my ear i can&amp;#39;t make out whatthey&amp;#39;re saying so as soon as i drift offthe pressure releases and i can stillhear that noise is being made but ican&amp;#39;t track it and so i&amp;#39;m usually outprobably in about three minutes wow thatthat changed my life in terms of when iget stressed i can still fall backasleep such a great skill and justreflecting on what you usethat murmur in the background and thiskind of low level i can&amp;#39;t quite detectit is actually the way that your braindetects things as you&amp;#39;re falling asleepso i wonder if you&amp;#39;ve triggered yourcircuit to run in reverse where youactually can send yourself back underwhat what it makes me think is that ican&amp;#39;tprocess the problemsand listen to a story at the same timeand so my brain clicks over into storymode and it&amp;#39;s like oh we&amp;#39;re digestingthis story i i&amp;#39;m getting input sobecause i&amp;#39;m getting input because it&amp;#39;sstory my brain lets go of i have tosolve problems and then that allows meto fall right back asleep that&amp;#39;s greatsuch a great skill and waking up in themiddle of the night from time to time touse the bathroom is actually quitenormaland some people are really obsessed bythe fact oh no i woke up and then theyget triggered but i learned this lastyear umthat thepeak in our alertness is actually about90 minutes before our natural bedtimeand a lot of people they you know theyreach the point in the evening wherethey&amp;#39;reready to go to sleep and then they feelall this you know excitement and surgeof energy and they think oh no i&amp;#39;m notgoing to be able to fall asleep butthat&amp;#39;s actually a natural surge that&amp;#39;sfollowed by a dip a lot of people alsohave the trouble of waking up in themiddle of the night and wondering whythey can&amp;#39;t fall back asleep this isdreadfully hard for a lot of people istruggled that for years yeah and one ofthe solutions is to go to bed earlierbecause it means that your melatonin isstarting to get released early in theevening and so we all have the naturalability to push to stay late stay uplater if we really need to this hasobvious adaptive utility but some peopleby who should go to bed quote unquoteshould go to bed at 9 or 10 p.m they&amp;#39;repushing to 11 or 12 and then theirmelatonin signal is starting to drop offnow they can&amp;#39;t fall asleepor they&amp;#39;re waking up at two or three inthe morning and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re introuble but it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve hitthe right schedule 93 hours is animpressive outputthat&amp;#39;s a lot of years of making anobscene amount of mistakes and to closethe loop on so people how do youaccomplish xyz and the answer is partlyrulesso you have to be obsessed with yourgoal right so for me that&amp;#39;s allobsessions start with a goal what do youwant is that thing exciting andhonorable assuming it&amp;#39;s exciting andhonorable there&amp;#39;s ways to like createfeedback loops which is largely whatwe&amp;#39;ve been talking about today aboutattaching the dopaminergic responsespecifically to the pursuit of thatthing rather than having itandbyto because i&amp;#39;m so excited and because iso believe in the reality of my goalsthat i actually could have them and thathaving them would be awesomei can create rules in my life and then ireally stick to those rules so once i&amp;#39;mvery careful about what rules i put inplace because i have to believe thatthey will actually lead me to this goalthat&amp;#39;s really exciting for me but if ibelieve it then i can put them in andthen also part of my identity is thati&amp;#39;m the type of person that when i set arule i follow it so i can create thisloop of like feeling good about myselfand the thing that i&amp;#39;m pursuing but itreally works and i&amp;#39;m shocked how fewpeople have the kind of rule that you&amp;#39;retalking about in the new year to say heyi&amp;#39;m only going to do odd hours there&amp;#39;sno phone yeah well and like i said i&amp;#39;mnot perfect i&amp;#39;m not as disciplined asyou are about my no goes i try iactually find that tabulating is is kindof funum it&amp;#39;s also fun to get reallytriggering commentsand and to not close the dopamine loopfor them i think if people understood umthe dopamine reward prediction errorthat we could end all the umamplifying comment battles onlinebecause what happens is if someone takesa a jab at you of any kind there&amp;#39;sactually an open dopamine loop waitingfor you to respond and any responseactually gives them that that dopamineresponse of success it&amp;#39;s a little bit ofa it&amp;#39;s like scoring a three-pointer andthe no response actually drops theirdopamine below baseline and that&amp;#39;s itsown form of retaliation and i have to becareful because i don&amp;#39;t want toencourage people to retaliate but anyanything that short-circuits the kind ofmadness of getting pulled intosome online battle that&amp;#39;s totallymeaningless it&amp;#39;s taking people away fromother powerful good things that theycould do in the worldyou know we&amp;#39;ve been talking mainly aboutdopamine and its scheduling and aboutthe fact that it can be attached toanything i thinkmany people find it hard to subjectivelyattach dopamine to something they don&amp;#39;twant to do this is something that uh ifwe&amp;#39;d spoken a year ago i would&amp;#39;ve i myanswer would have been a little bitdifferent to the question of how do youget motivated well one way to do that isif you are good at subjectivelyattachingdopamine to the pursuit just knowingokay i really am hungry for this i&amp;#39;mjust i&amp;#39;m going to tell myself that youknow making you know making it onepercent of the wayis a success and i&amp;#39;m going to keep goingand i&amp;#39;m going to keep ratcheting on andthat&amp;#39;s great if you can do that but forpeople that can&amp;#39;t do that understandingthis relationship with a pleasure painbalance can be more powerful justunderstanding the more friction and painthat you experience the greater thedopamine reward you will get later andthat serves as its own amplifier of thewhole process of pursuing more dopamineand then the other aspect of itis that any time that we&amp;#39;re leaning intoactionyou know it has thepossibility of being an amplifyingprocess or a depleting processand the key to that is making sure thatyou&amp;#39;re balancing the dopamine andepinephrine systems you know epinephrinebeing this molecule of universalcurrency of energy output it could beout of hate or it could be out of loveepinephrine doesn&amp;#39;t care and actuallydopamine doesn&amp;#39;t care none of thesesystems care about us they justwork underneath our underneath ourconscious control but when you start tounderstand thathitting the gas pedal is great buthitting the gas pedal and then comingoff the gas pedal a little bityou can kind of sit in a more relaxedrpm actually allows you to go muchfurther i think that peopleleaning into action is terrific i alwayssay you can either be back on your heelsflat footed or forward center of massthe best situation is actually to beright upright but just know that you canbe forward center of mass at any pointand you know that to take it back to sexand reproduction because it&amp;#39;s a salientexample the arc of of sex is veryinteresting because when you think aboutautonomic arousal it turns out that thethe arousal stage of sex actuallyinvolves release of dopaminebut is what we call parasympatheticdominant it&amp;#39;s actually has to be relaxedenoughin order to occur okay everyone can readbetween the lines on thisorgasm is actuallyai want to say full blown it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s ait is a sympatheticnervous system driven response it&amp;#39;sidentical to the stress system it&amp;#39;sdriven by the same neural circuits asstressand then what comes afterwardthe parasympathetic system goes back upagain it&amp;#39;s that deep relaxation so whydo i say this not to talk about sex tobeyou know to to serve as a highlighterbut rather our species arrived herebecause of this dance between arousaland relaxation arousal and relaxationand one thing we can say for sure aboutevery human being that&amp;#39;s alive now isthat their parents at least oncemastered this dance of relaxed but notand excited but not too excited thenreally excited and then relaxed thatdance was mastered by all of our parentsand that&amp;#39;s what delivered us here tosome extent and so iwhat this means is that all the neuralcircuits from the ones that led to ourconception to the ones that lead to uspursuing goals have thisbalance that&amp;#39;s almost like a like aseesaw right there&amp;#39;s activation and calmactivation and calm and it&amp;#39;s thatdynamic process that&amp;#39;s important tomaster in every endeavor so we use sexas an example but in pursuit of goalsyou have to learn how to pursueshort-term goalsand like the goals within the day make acup of coffee and goal and long-termgoals and when i said dopamine is what&amp;#39;ssetting theyour time perception it&amp;#39;s an intervaltimerwhat you&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s like the twomarshmallow experiment done at stanforddef defer the dopamineand actually if you can turn the waitinginto the dopamine and thenyou can extend out the reward for youknow waiting for the second marshmallow15 minutes later et cetera et cetera andthere are many many examples of this inthe psychology and neuroscienceliterature and i would say finally in2020 we finally as a field got a clearidea of how dopamine is really workingbecause before it was all aboutwork dopamine hit rightsex gives you a doubling hit theinternet gives you a dopamine what wedidn&amp;#39;t realize is that repeatedengagement with these things leads todopamine depletionand that the pain and pleasure balanceis always at workdude that&amp;#39;s so brilliant dudeone the huberman lab is amazing onyoutube people need to check that [ __ ]out and your instagram page is alsoamazingwhere do you want people to follow youat yeah so well thanks um for those kindwords um yes i mean them so aggressivelyi&amp;#39;ll bite through the camera to letpeople know how seriously i mean thatthank you yeah so i i have an instagrampage it&amp;#39;s huberman lab and there i teachneuroscience in anywhere from one minuteto you know five minute tidbits and alot of actionable tools that relate toall sorts of things sleep and motivationetc and then the huberman lab podcast isapple spotify and we have a youtubechannel for people want to watch andlisten to it and they&amp;#39;reit&amp;#39;s a little bit different than mostpodcasts because i will do four episodesall on one general theme like food andthe brainand these are longhour to two hour long lectures where ijust kind of blab on and on myself butthey&amp;#39;re all time stamps so people canget information there and it&amp;#39;s tools andscience and then we have great guests onwho are expert in their fields peoplelike anna lemke um luminaries and theyou know

great to be here i should say drandrew just just so people know whatthey&amp;#39;re what they&amp;#39;re about to get dudeit&amp;#39;s awesome to have you back our firstinterview completely melted my brainresearching you is one of my favoritethings to do the breadth of topics thatyou cover is incrediblenone more so than the fact that we canget to our mind through our body which ithink is one of the most incrediblethings before we started rolling thoughi had this whole interview planned iknew exactly where we were going to goand then you made a comment i wasbringing up bitcoin and uhcryptocurrency as i do because i&amp;#39;mobsessed and you said well there&amp;#39;s onlyone biological currency and that&amp;#39;sdopamine that&amp;#39;s right and i was likewell now i know where we&amp;#39;re startingwhat do you mean by that yeah so youknow human beings have evolved tons oftechnologiesand currenciesbitcoin ethereum are not topics i know alot a lot about but when you think aboutdollar euro bitcoin ethereum you thinkabout wins and lossesin sport in life in relationship andanything something in your brain andbody has to keep track of that did youwin did you lose what&amp;#39;s a letdown what&amp;#39;sa celebration andi think one of the most importantfindings in the last few years inneuroscience is thatwhile the molecule dopamine isassociated with rewardit&amp;#39;s more aboutmotivation and cravingthere&amp;#39;s a really classic experiment nowthat people use to demonstrate this taketwo ratsand the rats independently separatecages can lever pressfor fooduh when they can access foodthere&amp;#39;s a little bit of dopamine that&amp;#39;sreleased anytime they get some food sowe always thought that foodlike many other rewardslike food sex warmth when you&amp;#39;re coldcool when you&amp;#39;re too warmis triggering the release of dopaminebutsomeone had the good idea to depletedopamine in one of those animalsand then what you find is that theanimal withoutdopamine still enjoys foodstill enjoys other pleasures so dopamineis not really involved in the enjoymentof those pleasures it&amp;#39;s involved inmotivation because if you make theanimal have to move just one rat&amp;#39;slengthbelieve it or not to get to that leverthe animal with dopamine will work to goget that thing it will work through someeffort to go get the reward whereas theanimal or turns out the human withoutmuch dopaminecan still experience pleasure they cansit on their couch and cram their facewith pleasure inducing calories or whathave you watch pleasure-inducing thingson the television but they have verylittle motivation to go pursue thingsthat will deliver them pleasureso when i say dopamine is the universalcurrencyofeverything what i mean is it&amp;#39;s drivingthe motivation to develop new currencieswhen somebody can sit back and say uhi&amp;#39;ll just throw this number out let&amp;#39;ssay somebody has a hundred thousandbitcoins which presumably now is worthoh my godcertainly more than it was a few yearsagothe way they can register whether or notthey are in a position of wealth or nothas everything to do with the the numberthey see on the screen or in theirbitcoin walletbutthat number is converted into a chemicalsignal that has everything to do withhow much you had previously so so wecould talk about the so-called rewardprediction error how good you feel withan experience has everything to do withhow muchyou had previouslyand dopamine itself is what&amp;#39;s drivingthe human species tocreate these new technologies and sowhile we think of currencies as the goalit&amp;#39;s actually what&amp;#39;s really driven theforward evolution of our our species hasbeen the desire to go seek things beyondthe confines of our skin and when i saythe common currency is dopamine what imean is the molecule dopamine whensecreted in the brain makes us pursuethings build things create things makesus want new things that we don&amp;#39;tcurrently already have and so it has alot of dimensions to it but rather thanthink about dopamine as a signal forreward like a dopamine hit weclassically think to talk about it it&amp;#39;smore accurate really to think aboutdopamine as driving motivation andcraving to go seek rewards that&amp;#39;s therad experiment and it&amp;#39;s a way oftabulating where we are in our life arewe doing well or are we doing poorly andthat happens on very short time scaleslike do you wake up feeling good or doyou wake up feeling kind of loworon long time scales if you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough a long degree or you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough your life how are you doing howdo you gauge that well it has everythingto do with how much dopamine you werereleasing in the previous days and weeksand years so you&amp;#39;re always comparing andall of this is subconscious but what&amp;#39;scool is that once you make theseprocesses conscious once you understanda little bit about how dopamine isreleased and how it changes ourperspective and our behavior then youcan actually work with it so it&amp;#39;s one oftheum instances where knowledge ofknowledge actually turns out to be areally useful tooldude that&amp;#39;s crazy to me so one of thethings that i get hit up about all thetime ispeople feel stuckand as you like really push on them tofigure out why they feel stuck they&amp;#39;llbe like yeah i want to do that and but ijust you know i can&amp;#39;t get out of bed ori don&amp;#39;t have the energy to pursue it orwhatever andyou get into thiscommon thing that people say in mindsetand i really believe it but i find itfar more interesting when you&amp;#39;re talkingabout it from a neuro chemicalstandpoint which is you just don&amp;#39;t wantit badly enoughand when i think aboutmy own life i sometimes worrythat i&amp;#39;m either more malleable thanother people or that i have a greaterability to manipulate my dopaminerelease or whateverbecause i&amp;#39;m very good at building desireand i like the way that desire feels nowwhen you use the word hunger i thinkpeople get confused because i actuallydon&amp;#39;t enjoy being hungry for food i findthat totally unpleasurablehowever being hungry for sex i findincredibly i feel alive i feel focused ifeel energized i feel aggressive it&amp;#39;scomplex for sure but i find that feelingincred the the act of wanting somethingin the future in in that kind or inbusiness and trying to build somethingi&amp;#39;ve in fact that&amp;#39;s an interestinginsight into my own selfabouti like to buildanddo we know so we dopamine is theneurochemistry of the pursuit of makingsure that i have the energy to go but dowe know how we can spike thatwell first of all it&amp;#39;s clear to me basedon your description that you&amp;#39;ve tappedinto theseuh channels that release dopaminebecause craving and wanting whether ornot it&amp;#39;s sex or or uh money orconnectionor anything all right uh is that&amp;#39;s thethe primary trigger for dopamine releaseyeah now sex and reproduction makes themost sense from the perspective ofevolution uh i mean any species everyspecieshas tends to have two primary goals oneprotect it&amp;#39;s young and second make moreof itself usually in reverse order rightso even for people that don&amp;#39;t wantchildren i mean you might not or peopleof course not everyone is having sexjust to reproduce but at a primordiallevel that&amp;#39;s what those circuits arethere for so every species in particularmammalian species where there&amp;#39;s a lot ofparenting and caretakingof the youngtries to take make more of itself andeverything that you see like maternalaggression which is a powerful circuitthat gets activated afterfemales of any species in particularmammals give birth they will fight tothe death and they gain superhumanstrength in order to protect their youngthat&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a known circuit forthat in the brain that gets

you&amp;#39;re one it&amp;#39;ll besuper interesting because you&amp;#39;ll know ifshe&amp;#39;s on the right track from aneuroscience perspective i rememberreading the book at the time i thought iwas going to have kidsand i remember thinking whoa like thisbook chronicles what happens to awoman&amp;#39;s brain and how things change andi was like when you have kids man youare inviting aneurochemical change in your significantother that is going to play itself outin a very real way and i&amp;#39;d be lying if isaid that wasn&amp;#39;t one of the things oneof the many things but one of the thingsthat i factored into not having kidsinteresting uh and then the same withmenopause that it&amp;#39;s this really dramaticsort of reorganizing might not be theright word but that it it has realimplications in theway that the person moves just as thedecline of testosterone has in men wellin on aon the positive sideduring pregnancy the woman&amp;#39;s hippocampusher brain area associated with memoryand retention of information it goesthrough a period in which it gets worsefor certain types of information butthen achieves superior levels of workingmemory oncethe babies arrive because there are alot of things to manage so this makessense this is true in rodents this istrue in humans and then in terms of thebiology of the father we now know thatwhen because typically parents have uhyou know does seem like one spousealways does more than the otherbut even in the most evenly dividedhouseholdsthe there&amp;#39;s usually some co-parenting ofsome sort but that the father has abig increase in the hormone prolactinwhenthe mother is expecting and theprolactin lays down body fat it preparesfor sleepless nights for women it itsparks um the circuitry for milk letdownfor for nursingso the dad bod has a lot to do withprolactin this is true in in birds insmall mammals and in humans and this isnow there was a paper published innatureon humans specifically about this andwhen you think about the relationshipbetween dopamine and prolactin it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;sinteresting and it takes us back to thismotivation and craving that you weredescribing earlier which is thatdopamine and prolactin work in inopposite fashionso the the most salient example of thisis sex and reproduction whereanticipation of sex and reproductiongreatly increases dopaminebut postsreproductivepost-sex it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be forreproduction there&amp;#39;s a spark inprolactin in the mail that&amp;#39;s the spikeexcuse me in prolactin and that spike inprolactin is actually what sets therefractory period during which he can&amp;#39;tmate again so it sets a period ofquiescence to keepmen it&amp;#39;s repair bonding for the exchangeof chemicals through the nose to thethrough the skin and through the sweatmainly through odor uh we could talkabout pheromones if you want but that&amp;#39;sa topic that&amp;#39;s somewhat controversialthe actual identity of pheromones inhumans has not been identified but thereare pheromone effects in humanscontroversial in that people don&amp;#39;t agreewhat&amp;#39;s really happening well okay sothere&amp;#39;s this culture of biologists thathave clearly identifiedpheromone effects in other in non-humansand non-human primatesbut whether or not those arethe classic definition of a pheromoneeffect is that it&amp;#39;s subconscious thatyou can&amp;#39;t actually detect the smellhowever we know that smells themselvesconscious detection of them can evokevery robust physiological responses oneone example to just stay in this arenaof of of thought is that a guy by thename of gnome sobel who&amp;#39;s at theweizmann institute he used to be atberkeley he has a lab over in israel hisamazing lab works on olfactionsmell and they discovered that the scentof women&amp;#39;s tears causes a dramatic andsignificant reduction in testosterone inmen what absolutely and this waspublished if anyone wants to go look itup it was published in science magazineyou know you can smell tears yeah wehave you know the super bowl ofpublishing and science is science natureand self those are the three topjournals this is published in sciencemagazine very stringent uh the smell oftears now it&amp;#39;s subconscious at somelevelbut the other thing that if we weregoing to kind of play around in thishormones and behave interactions betweenhumans um there are some reallyinteresting examples so for instancemenwill rate the smell of a woman&amp;#39;s skin orsweat or the perception of her face asmore beautiful during the pre-ovulatoryphase of her menstrual cyclethat pre-ovulatory phase is associatedwith a number of different changes inhormones okayjust that smell will increasetestosterone in a maleoral contraception in the femalewomen taking oral contraception itadjusts their hormones such that men nolonger detect this change inhow attractive women are doesn&amp;#39;t meanthey find them unattractive but it meansthey don&amp;#39;t find them increasinglyinteractive during this certain periodof the of their of their menstrual cycleso we are constantly signaling back andforth through hormones in fact we metover thereand shook hands because we&amp;#39;ve beentested for covet and the rest we shookhands andwhat happened and what happens within 30seconds of any human being contactingone another is they shake hands and thenthey wipe their the chemicals of theother person on their facegnome&amp;#39;s lab has also shown this and sowe are constantly signaling throughthrough chemical exchange sometimes it&amp;#39;ssubconscious and those are the so-calledpheromone effects sometimes it&amp;#39;s lowlevels of odors that are beneath ourconscious detection and sometimes it&amp;#39;soutright wow this person smells reallyreally good or they look particularlygood today oftentimes that&amp;#39;s tied to theof the period in which they areovulating in their menstrual cycle so iwant to plant a flag here about all thethings that we dothat aremessing with these mechanisms likecologne or deodorant or oralcontraception of which i&amp;#39;m not saying ispornography like all interception hasserved a great role in it for certainpeople some people might say was this anethical discussion or is it good is itbad but um either way it is having aneffect right so to remove i only look atthings through the lens of biology notthrough the lens of of whether or not weshould or shouldn&amp;#39;t do things i love itokay so we&amp;#39;re planning that we&amp;#39;re comingback to it but now i want to get to howdo we spike intentionally you&amp;#39;ve talkedabout we can spike testosterone but iwant to know can we spike dopamineyeah so um and you&amp;#39;ve done this so yourexample ofcraving isactually what you crave you crave thefeeling of craving is beautiful becauseit would what it means is that you don&amp;#39;tallow yourself to go so far down the arcof the dopamine trajectory to get to theother source of motivation so there aretwo sources of motivation as it relatesto dopamine and then we can think abouttools that we could export from thesethat are nested in neurobiologythe first is to do what you dowhich is to be able to sense the cravingas its own form of pleasure this haskind of remnants of carol dweck&amp;#39;s growthmindset that you eventually develop apleasure in the seeking and the strivinghas you know uh has flavors of a davidgoggins type approach where where itseems like he gets pleasure from thefriction itself and so there areelements of that you seem to have thatas wellbutif you can start to identify the cravingas its own internally released drug thisthing dopamine that is a source ofmotivation then what you realize is thatcapturing the reward is wonderfulbut attaching dopamine to the reward isactually a little bit dangerousattaching yeah this is celebrating thewin celebrating the win more than thepursuit it actually sets you up forfailure in the future and so this getsus right into something called dopaminereward prediction error and rewardprediction error is basically if youexpect something to be really greatand then it&amp;#39;s not quite that great yourdopamine baseline lowers and nowunderstanding what we know aboutdopamine that means that not only didyou you feel as if you lost because itwasn&amp;#39;t as much a celebration as youthought it would be but it also meansthat you&amp;#39;re starting from a lower placemeaning you are less motivated now thesimpler way to conceptualize this ishave a colleague at stanford she runsthe addiction dual diagnosis clinic atuh her name is dr anna lemke she has abook called dopamine nation that&amp;#39;s outright nowand she&amp;#39;s really described as pleasurepain balance where anytime you have abunch of dopamine and you&amp;#39;re in pursuitpursuit pursuitafter you achieve a win now this couldbe a business win a relationship a winof any kindbutinevitably there&amp;#39;s going to be a tippingback of the scale on the pain side andthat pain side is always going to go alittle bit higher than the dopamine sideso this is what you would feel if youpursued a goal like building a bigcompanyhere it comes here comes the big saleand then there&amp;#39;s the well what now thekind of letdown now if you wait if yousimply wait and stop pursuing dopaminefor a short while the scale starts toresetthe problem is a lot of peopleimmediately roll right into the nextpursuitand then what happens is that scalestarts to get stuck on the pain side alittle bit more a little bit more alittle bit more and pretty soon noamount of seeking will allow you toexperience that craving and motivationso what what does this mean in terms ofan actual tool well first of allif people can do what you do they&amp;#39;regoing to be in a much better position inlife it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s schoolsport relationship any domain of life ifyou can start to register ah thatcraving and that friction and thatdesire that almost kind of low level ofagitation sometimes high level ofagitation that is that i&amp;#39;m trying toimpose my will on the world in abenevolent way we hopethat&amp;#39;s dopamine it&amp;#39;s working with itsclose cousin which is epinephrine whichis adrenaline they are very closecousins in fact dopamine manufacturesepinephrine a lot of people don&amp;#39;t knowthis but adrenaline is actually madefrom the molecule dopamineokay so those two are hanging outtogether it&amp;#39;s like crave work crave workcraving work craving work craving workand then you get the winand some peopleallow the big peak in dopamine to beassociated with the winandsmart peoplelearn to adjust their celebrationinternally right this is all internalyou could throw the biggest party in theworld but as long as you&amp;#39;re kind of inlaid backandlooking at this not letting yourself getmanic crazyyou won&amp;#39;t necessarily crash as hardand pretty soon your system will resetso you take the day you clean up thedishes you relax you go what now i&amp;#39;mfeeling a little low well rather thangoing out and spiking your dopamineagain just wait understand that thescale will reset again give yourself afew days where you&amp;#39;re going to feel alittle kind of underwhelmed thingsaren&amp;#39;t going to be as interestingit&amp;#39;s going to be hard to trigger thatbig release because you just hadthe peakwell if you adjust that you relax youunderstand there&amp;#39;s always a little bitof a postpartum depressionwe sometimes hear about postpartumdepression that&amp;#39;s a clinical thing butthere&amp;#39;s always that kind of today&amp;#39;s notas excitingas the previous days what am i going todo with my life but thenif you let it start ratcheting up againthen what you realize is your capacityto tap into dopamine as a motivator notjust seeking dopamine rewards that isinfinite and i i can say with with greatcertainty that this ishow you were able to build a big companyand sell it how you&amp;#39;ve been able tobuild a successful podcast and sell ithow you constantly seeking becauseseeking is the reward and i think formost people we think of the reward asthe finish line and so the key is to getto the finish line step into the endzone but no end zone dance it&amp;#39;s justlike yep and now i&amp;#39;m gonna go do itagainthat&amp;#39;s really the key that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s thekey to doing it over and over and when isee big athletes oracademics or anyone or musicians andtheyrise and crashit&amp;#39;s clear they&amp;#39;ve lost the touch withthe motivation evoked dopamine andthey&amp;#39;ve lost touch probably because ithasn&amp;#39;t really been described by theneuroscience community until anna hasstarted talking about this stuffpublicly and i&amp;#39;m just kind of echoingwhat she&amp;#39;s beautifully saidsaid much better than i am which is thatyou should always expect that after abunch of pleasure there&amp;#39;s going to bethat low and then that craving how do iget back to there again and the key isyou have to walk the staircase again youdon&amp;#39;t get to do this as a square wavepull you know you don&amp;#39;t get to justascend ascend ascend it&amp;#39;s always updownup a little bit higher down up you knowit&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the functionso um i don&amp;#39;t know if that resonateswith your experience i&amp;#39;m over herefreaking out so you&amp;#39;ve literally justexplained what i will say is the singlemost important loop if you want to besuccessfuland you used wordsattach right you had another one whichwas about your t i forget the exact wordbut you&amp;#39;re taking you&amp;#39;re insertingyourself consciously into the processbecause what i learned very early on andi&amp;#39;m so grateful in the same way that youare grateful that your upbringing wasn&amp;#39;tperfect but it ended up giving you aframe of reference and insights thathave propelled you forward i&amp;#39;m verygrateful that i spent a decade justtrying to get rich that was the statedmission i would say it every day likei&amp;#39;m here to get rich i show up to workto get rich it&amp;#39;s about getting rich richrich rich and it didn&amp;#39;t workand so and my wife pulls me aside andshe&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re now damaging themarriage like you&amp;#39;re just so fiendishlyfocused on the goalthat there&amp;#39;s nothing as integrated inyour life you&amp;#39;re doing something youhate for an end state that may nevercomeand that was so profound and it shook meso deeply and it suddenly became clearthat from a neurological perspectivewhat i wanted was to feel alive and oncei put everything in the pursuit i&amp;#39;m justinterested in can i show up every dayand sincerely pursue this thing which imay never get but i&amp;#39;m gonna honor myselfcelebrate myself big up myself as thebrits would say for just showing uptoday and actually trying to make ithappenand one that&amp;#39;s way more sustainable andthen two you don&amp;#39;tyou don&amp;#39;t get tricked into thinking thatoh when i get this thing that i&amp;#39;ll feelgood because it&amp;#39;s the craving that makesme feel alive so it&amp;#39;s the state ofwanting that is in and of itself thepleasurable act that&amp;#39;s right and soi began to use the metaphor of i&amp;#39;m gonnaclimb this mountain only to want thenext mountain to climb and once i knewthat well then you have to be totallycomfortable dropping back down andstarting all over now the interestingthing and i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m foolingmyself or if i haveso integrated that trickbut the come down isn&amp;#39;t hard for me soi i think my last day at quest was amondayand tuesday i started impact theory andso that went from i had 3 000 employeesyour position matters you get a lot ofdeference uh you&amp;#39;ve got a privilegedparking space you know what i mean likethere&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that gointo it andbut i didn&amp;#39;t none of like my rewardsystem was tied to that so it was veryeasy for me to start the next day withthere was only seven of us and no onehad time for any deference of any kindand i went from having an ea which youcan&amp;#39;t imagine how amazing that is to notand you&amp;#39;re doing everything for yourselfagainbut that wasn&amp;#39;t a painful thing becausei was so focused on all right cool thisis step one again and now can can werepeat well it helps if you can expectthat there will be a little bit of a dippost win or postwhatever um that&amp;#39;s helpful there&amp;#39;salways a refractory period of any kindso to speak if you expect it that&amp;#39;sgreat because you eliminate the thedownside of the reward prediction errorreward prediction error can also beconceptualized as i tell you we&amp;#39;re goingto go this restaurant i keep building upthe food building up the food i actuallyraised the expectation and therequirement that that food be reallyspectacular better off i just tell youit&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty good and thenyou&amp;#39;re wowed by it right because if yourdopamine was higher in anticipation thanthe actual food evoked well then itmakes sense why would you&amp;#39;re alwaysintegrating over the dopamine releaseyou had previouslynow there are a couple things that yousaid in there that i want to highlightwhich i find so interesting uh and wecan get a little biteastern philosophy mystical here but tieit back to some real neuroscience whichis you said you know that&amp;#39;s the juicethe motivation is the juice you knowthatif you look at eastern philosophy andthey talk about qi you know in this youknow what is that i i wager that isdopamine the desire to pursue things andto create more of oneself andas a species whether or not you decideto have kids or not those circuits alluse the one universal currency dopamineof wanting more things that are outsidethe confines of your skin and that&amp;#39;swhat&amp;#39;s driven forward evolution ofindividuals andfamilies and cultures and our ourspecies as a whole and again thecircuitry has been there for many manytens if not hundreds of thousands ofyearsand so it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s highly conservedand so what that means is that itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s bitcoin orethereum it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;sputting rockets on other planets itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s building thefirst automobile it&amp;#39;s the same currencyso understanding those cycles is reallykey the other thing is the element ofpain i think that understanding thatpain and pleasure and this reallydynamic balancecan also help us which in the followingwayany pain that you feel the longer daythe less sleep the the kind of agonythat things aren&amp;#39;t working that poweroutlet doesn&amp;#39;t work or the internet isslow whatever it isthe amount of pleasure that you willeventually experienceis directly relation related excuse meto how much pain you experience so weknow this from actually what nowadayswould be considered quite barbaric andunethical experiments where they wouldgive people electrical shocksand they would measure their responseand then they&amp;#39;d say we&amp;#39;re going toincrease it we&amp;#39;re going to increase iteventually they get to the point where aslight shock that was previously verypainful actually evokes a sense ofpleasurenow you couldn&amp;#39;t do these experimentsanymore these are not the experiments ido in my labthese are older experiments butfor instance and this has been discussedin scientific research papers uh givingsomebody a like a 10-minute ice bath forinstance or even a three-minute ice bathor a one-minute ice bath it&amp;#39;s quitepainful but there was a study from theuniversity of prague uh european journalphysiology showed that after a painfulice bath stimulusthe amount of dopamine release goes upfor two and a half hours to 250 percentabove baseline and that&amp;#39;s not becausethe ice bathitself evokes dopamine release a lot ofpeople think oh cold water of oxdopamine release no pain evokes dopaminerelease after the pain is over yesterdayi tweaked my back because i do thisstupid thing every few years the samestupid thing and it&amp;#39;s really painful andthen you just remember all the ways inwhich you can&amp;#39;t move around i was likestanding up this morning like ah andjust walking is so painful as the painhas started to dissipate you get alittle bit of a high right you get alittle bit of a euphoria that&amp;#39;s dopaminebecause of the the degree of pain youexperienced previously predicts how muchpleasure so when you start a companydown in the dregs and you&amp;#39;re shovelingagainthat&amp;#39;s beautiful because that means thatthe wind that you achieveis going to be as good or greater thanthe one you had previously in your casewith quest and so we go back to thisexample the person that&amp;#39;s not motivatedthat can&amp;#39;t get off the couch thatdoesn&amp;#39;t want to do anything well this isthe problem we remember the radexperiment they are effectively the ratwith no dopamine but they can stillachievesome sense of pleasureby consuming excess calories byconsuming social media and look i&amp;#39;m notjudging i do this stuff too rightscrolling social media if you&amp;#39;ve everscrolled social media and you&amp;#39;re like idon&amp;#39;t even know why i&amp;#39;m doing this itdoesn&amp;#39;t really feel that goodand i can remember a time where you&amp;#39;dsee something it was just so cool or yousee something online i remember thiswhen ted talks first came out i was likethis is amazing these are some at leastsome of them are really smart peoplesharing really cool insights and thennow that they&amp;#39;re like a gazillion tedtalks i remember spending a winter in myoffice at when i was a junior professorcleaning my office finallyand binging ted talks in the backgroundthinking this is a good use of my timepretty soon they all sucked to me i waslike this isn&amp;#39;t good so what you need todo is stop watching dead docs for awhilewait and then they become interestingagain and that&amp;#39;s this pain pleasurebalanceand so for people that aren&amp;#39;t feelingmotivated the problem is they&amp;#39;re notmotivated but they&amp;#39;re getting justenough or excess sustenance so they&amp;#39;regetting the little mild hits of opioidit becomes an opioid system and if youthink about the opioid drugs as opposedto dopamine dopaminergic drugsdopaminergic drugs make people rabid foreverything you know drugs of abuse likecocaine amphetamine make peopleincredibly outward directed or theyhardly notice anything except what theywant more of more more it&amp;#39;s veryit&amp;#39;s badbecause those drugs trigger so muchdopamine release that they become thereward it&amp;#39;s very circular that only thedrug can give that much dopamine nothingthey could pursue would give them asmuch dopamine as the drug itselfso there&amp;#39;s that and then there&amp;#39;s thekind of opioid like effectsof constantly indulging oneself withsocial media or with video games or withwith food or with anything to the pointwhere it no longer evokes the motivationand craving and this is really the newevolution of the understanding ofdopamine and neuro in neuroscience whichis that dopamine itself is not thereward it&amp;#39;s the build-up to the rewardand the reward has more of a kind ofopioid bliss-like property which itselfis not bad if it&amp;#39;s endogenous releasedfrom within but when we can just sitthere like the like the rat with nodopamine gorging ourselves withpleasures so to speak what you end upwith is somebody that feels reallyunmotivated and those pleasures nolonger work to tickle those feel-goodcircuits and so there&amp;#39;s no reason forthem to go out and pursue anything andthat&amp;#39;s a pretty dark picture so the thekeys areto pursue rewards but understand thatthe pursuit is actually the rewardif you want to have repeatedwins okay you the celebration has to beless than the pursuit and that&amp;#39;s hardfor some people to dothey you know they it&amp;#39;s got to be thatyour celebration is slightly lessdopaminergicit can be very reflective you can be ingratitude those are otherneurotransmitter systems but you don&amp;#39;twant to be on that high as you celebratethe windyou want to betrickling out your dopamineregularly until you pursue things andthen just understand there will alwaysbe a crash of pain and the more pain youexperience the more dopamine you canachieve if you get back on the avenue ofperfect yeah this gets into unintendedconsequences of modernity and so we&amp;#39;reliving through this time where we youknow going back to that flag that weplanted of these unintended consequencesof oh i can make myself smell good oh ican you know watch the coolest video ohlike tick tockdude i don&amp;#39;t have an addictivepersonality that&amp;#39;s the first thing wherei&amp;#39;ll lose an hour and be like what the[ __ ] did i just do well that&amp;#39;sthe problem is not pleasures the problemis that pleasure experienced withoutprior requirement for pursuit yesisterrible for us it&amp;#39;s terrible for us asindividuals it&amp;#39;s terrible for us as asgroups and i have great confidence inthe human species to work this out butwe are finding now and we are going toincreasingly find that those who will besuccessful young or old are going to bethose people who can create their owninternal buffers they&amp;#39;re going to beable to control their relationship topleasures because the proximity topleasures and their availability is theproblem if you look atthe increase inuse of drugs of abuse or prescriptionmedication which at least at the firstpass deliver pleasure pain relief thewhole issue with the opioid crisis andand dopaminergic drugs like ritalinadderallyou know there is sometimes there&amp;#39;s aclinical need but tons of people aretaking those recreationally now or tostudy huge dopamine increases are whatthose causethat is a problem that&amp;#39;s a seriousproblem because it creates a cycle whereyou you need more of that specific thingi always say addictionis a progressive narrowing of the thingsthat bring you pleasure that&amp;#39;s such agood difference and you know and i don&amp;#39;tlike to comment too much onenlightenment because you know i don&amp;#39;treally know what that is as aneurobiologist but a good life we couldsay is a progressive expansion of thethings that bring you pleasure and evenbetter is a good life is a progressiveexpansion of the things that bring youpleasure and includes pleasure throughmotivation and hard work andunderstanding this pain pleasure balancewhereby if you experience pain and youcan continue to be in that friction andexert effortthe rewards are that much greater whenthey arriveand soi think that if you look at any drug ofabuse or any situation where somebodyisn&amp;#39;t motivated or thinks that now theymay have clinically diagnosed attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder but a lotof what people think is adhd it turnsout is people just over consumingdopamine from various sources and thenand also the context within a tick tockfeed is the context switch is insane thebrain has never seen first of allthere&amp;#39;s a first time in human evolutionthat we wrote with our thumbs but that&amp;#39;sa pretty benign shift and that the othershift isnormally you walk from one room toanother or from a field into the treesor from a hut into or a house orwhatever it is but now you can get 10000 context switches in that 30 minutesof scrolling on instagram or to talk andso it&amp;#39;s all about self-regulation we aregoing to select for the people that canself-regulate andso then people say well how do youself-regulate how do kids self-regulatewell this is my hope and one of thereasons i&amp;#39;ve gotten excited about publiceducation and teaching neuroscience isthatthis is a place where knowledge ofknowledge actually can allow oneself tointervene when you think i&amp;#39;m feeling lowi don&amp;#39;t feel good nothing really feelslike am i depressed maybe but maybeyou&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;ve saturated thedopamine circuits you&amp;#39;re now in the painpart of things what do you do well youhave to stop you need you need toreplenish dopamine you need to stopengaging with this behavior and thenyour pleasure for it will come back butyou have to constantly control the hingeit&amp;#39;s not just about being back and forthon the seesaw you have to make sure thehinge doesn&amp;#39;t get stuck in pain or inpleasure so it&amp;#39;s a dynamic process beinga human being it&amp;#39;s not easy and rememberthese circuits didn&amp;#39;t evolve for thispurposethey evolve primarily formaking more of ourselves that&amp;#39;s whythey&amp;#39;re so closely tied to thereproductive circuits and that&amp;#39;s why itwas interesting and very relevant thatyou said that yourdesire to have sex with your wife is oneof the most powerful feelings and itkind of as a from a neurochemicalperspective it wicks out into all theseother pursuits right those otherpursuits aren&amp;#39;t about sex per se butit&amp;#39;s the same molecules so the feelingis the same it&amp;#39;s just that some peoplefor some people the amplitude of thatdopamine signal for craving sex is veryhigh for some people that&amp;#39;s lower andit&amp;#39;s higher for um video games you knowwhatever you lean intoand and youthink about oftenin these pursuits we&amp;#39;ll start to reshapethese circuits because thesedopaminergic circuits are tied toeverything you know there are examplesof people getting addicted to the mostincredible things they&amp;#39;re also examplesof people getting very good but notaddicted to chess for instance it&amp;#39;s allthe samegeneral set of mechanismsyeah you talked earlier aboutthe the knowledge of knowledge and thatwas the big breakthrough for me at thedarkest period of my life i happened tograb a book we talked about this brieflyin our first interview i happened tograb a book that talked aboutneuroplasticity and they werehypothesizing maybe this is a thingandthatgave me hope because i could imaginewhat was going on in my brain and once ican visualize it then i feel like i caninsert myself into it it&amp;#39;s why i&amp;#39;vegotten so interested in health why i&amp;#39;mso interested in neuroscienceis for me if i were sliding towardsdepression i would do exactly whatyou&amp;#39;re saying i would assess that and belike okay wait a second i know that ican insert conscious control i know thatthis is abiological experience and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;mobsessed with that idea that you&amp;#39;rehaving a biological experience and to melike there&amp;#39;s some people that see theway the magic trick is done and it losesthe magic then for other people it&amp;#39;slike you see that it&amp;#39;s this is somebodythat&amp;#39;s spent 30 000 hours learning howto move their hands so that you don&amp;#39;tnotice that they just move the coin youknow from this hand to this hand it&amp;#39;sit blows me away i love magic uh beforethe pandemic a friend took me up to themagic castle here in hollywood andthere&amp;#39;s some incredible stuff going onmagic is actually really cool we coulduh just as a from a neuroscienceperspective magic it&amp;#39;s all aboutcreating gaps in your perception that&amp;#39;sobvious rightand when that happens because the thebrain is so accustomed to the laws ofphysics like objects fall down not upetc when that happens it clearlytriggers the surprise circuitry and thatitself that feeling of delight andsurprise is absolutely tied also tothese dopamine dopamine circuits it&amp;#39;sinteresting though that that doesn&amp;#39;tsend us into like terror like the peopledepends on the magic trick when i wentthere there was this crazy trick thatthe guy did he took out cards and i wasinvited up to sit next to him i signedmy name on a cardi took the card i took the cardi tore it up i put it in my pocketand at the end of the show we wentthrough a series of things at the end ofthe show hetook off his shoe and presented the cardto me with the signature intact and thecard intact and that was my signatureso he clearly created gaps of perceptionum but at some point as adults so ithink as long as we know the context isright then we can we can do this onething about dopamine that i just want tomake sure iuh mention and it based on something yousaid earlier is thatone interesting question about the brainis just asking the question you know howdo we segment time how do we how do youknow that this podcast has obviously hasa beginning in the middle and an end butyou know how do we segment time and sothere have been some beautifulexperiments done recently showing thatuh for instance if you&amp;#39;re watching asports game regardless of whether or notyour team scores like let&amp;#39;s saybasketball goes down court let&amp;#39;s saythey missed the three-pointer and thenyou know it&amp;#39;s a close game there&amp;#39;s alittle blip of dopamine that says thatwas one segment of timeand so dopamine is a big way in which wesegment time the other way are blinksbelieve it or notyeah that every time we blink there&amp;#39;s apaper publishing current biology everytime we blink we reset our perception ofthat when i understand more i guess thanthe dopamine why would dopamine beinvolved in time perfect question turnsout that the frequency of blinking isset by the level baseline level ofdopamine in the brain yes so when peopleare wide-eyed with excitement andthey&amp;#39;re and they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re notblinking very often or someone is on adrug that kicks out a lot of dopaminethey hardly ever blink their pupils arehugethey&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re actually not segmentingtime in the normal fashionand so much of your life in retrospectis segmented by those peaks and dopaminethey those mark key events in your lifewhen you met your wife uh that theirtheirall the segments of your life are arenoted by peaks and dopamine or the waythat you happen to conceptualizedopamine and so also people who aredepressed are often very focused on thepast they ruin naturally they default toruminating on the past when you adjustpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine levels to healthylevels they start becoming more forwardthinking and more present and so there&amp;#39;sthis relationship between blinking andtime perception dopamine and blinkinghow you conceptualize time has a lot todo with these peaks and dopamine andwhen they occurand this is a big deal because we&amp;#39;re youknow 2020 was a rough year for mostpeople 2021&amp;#39;s feeling a little betterbut we don&amp;#39;t really know where we are inthis whole arc of everything that&amp;#39;shappeningthere&amp;#39;s a lot of uncertainty yeahthe dopamine peaks and the frequency ofthose dopamine peaks have everything todo with how we carve up our experienceof time and anyone who spent a lot oftime in deep meditationstarts to develop a kind of intuitiveinternal representation of the fact thattime is very fluid in this way when wesay time is fluid what we mean is thesecretion of dopamine and these pulsesis very fluid they are under control ofour of what&amp;#39;s happening externally butalso how you conceptualize your lifelike where are you in your life are youyou know hopefully we&amp;#39;ll if davidsinclair has his way and hopefully hewill we will all live to be you knowmore than a hundred years oldhopefully in good vitality so this isthe more esoteric aspect of dopaminereal fast before we go about the timething yeah let me ask you so there was aperiod in my life i&amp;#39;ll take it at abouttwo years where for whatever reason i itcould have been six hours since i lastlooked at a clock i would be withinthree minutes of what time it was and mywife found it hilarious and so she&amp;#39;d belike what time is it and i&amp;#39;m like ohit&amp;#39;s 4 58.it was so weird that it like made myradar is like oh my god i have like thisspecial power and then it went awayand now i can probably get you within 15minutes but like uh it was really eerieis is there does that make a predictionor a round likea consistency of dopamine release orsomething yeah you nailed it it&amp;#39;s theconsistency that&amp;#39;s an internal it&amp;#39;s aninterval timer as we say so whenpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine is low they tend tooverestimate okay okayand when people&amp;#39;s dopamine is high theytend to underestimate time now it istrue that dopamine when it&amp;#39;s released isa little bit of a stimulant in thesystem because of the way it works withepinephrine how finely you slice time isvery dependent on dopamine and yourinternal level of autonomic arousal areally good example would be you&amp;#39;rereally excited about something or you&amp;#39;rereally stressed about something doesn&amp;#39;tmatter dopamine iselevated in excitement butnorepinephrine epinephrine tend to beelevated any time we&amp;#39;re agitated or orexcitedjust imagine you need to catch a flightyou&amp;#39;re in line at the security and theperson in front of you seems likethey&amp;#39;re going really really slowly yourframe rate is faster you&amp;#39;re just carvingup time more finely people are in caraccidents and then they reporteverything being in slow motion yourframe rate is issmaller you&amp;#39;re essentially gettingyou&amp;#39;re taking larger time bins and thisis why let&amp;#39;s say you wake up and you&amp;#39;rereally tired or you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re kindof out of it and you look and it&amp;#39;s liketext messages and emails and all thisstuff the world seems like it&amp;#39;s going byreally really fastdopamine is what is the diagno is thedynamic process by dopamine release ishould say is the dynamic process bywhich you adjust time perception so ifyou had a very keen perception of thepassage of time right down to the minuteor so that suggests very regularintervals of dopamine release and that&amp;#39;sprobably tied to outside events that arebelow your conscious awarenessbutuh dopamine releases i i sort ofnot to make this uh pg-13 or r-rated butif we go back to the example of sex sexand sleep are the two times when spaceand time have a very fluid typerelationship it&amp;#39;s veryhard to conceive space and time in sleepthat&amp;#39;s actually the nature of sleep iswe do the long blink no joke we closethe shutters stop bringing in externalinformation and in sleep space and timeare veryfluid right things can happen very fastor very slow slow motion you can beflying it there&amp;#39;s a lot of you know someof it is dreaming but space and time arevery fluid in wakefulnessspace and time are very anchored byphysical events in the world but ourperception of those is dynamicallyregulated by how much dopamine is in oursystem so it&amp;#39;s beginning to sound likedopamine does everything but it&amp;#39;s reallyassociated with motivation craving andtime interval keeping and so i would bewilling to bet that your pulses ofdopamine were very regular just likedropsso interesting so we do a lot of thingswho knows what i was doing at thatperiod if it had to do anything justthat i&amp;#39;m getting older and so it startsto disrupt itself who knows butwhat are some things so one thing i&amp;#39;veheard you talk about which i find reallyinterestingwhen i think about all the things thatwe&amp;#39;re doing that are disrupting thingsall these unintended consequences ofmodern behaviori am truly glad thatcell phones the internet and pornographydid not exist when i was younger becausei don&amp;#39;t know if at 14i could have been disciplined enough ifi had access to that andwhat like when you think about thethings that we&amp;#39;re doing right now thatare sort of the that have maybe the mostgrand unintended consequences where doyou landyeah on the time scale of 24 hours oneof the the huge mistakes that we allmake and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;ve said this many timesso if people have heard me say thisbefore forgive me but it turns out it&amp;#39;sstill trueuhgetting too much bright light exposurefrom the hours of 10 pm until 4 amunless you have to work shift work whichis a unique casethat bright light exposure between 10 pmand 4 am even if youadjust the colors of the lights youstill need to get everything reallyreally dim because it actuallyblocks the release of dopamine through apathway that involves a structure calledthe habenulathe habenula was a kind of crypticstructure in the brain for a long timebut now we know there&amp;#39;s a punishmentsignal in the brain you getneurochemically punishedfor viewing bright light at those hourshow how would that be wired in we&amp;#39;dnever be able to expose ourselves tobright light ah so that&amp;#39;s a greatquestion so firelight won&amp;#39;t do thatmoonlight&amp;#39;s fine candles lights that aredim are now in your environmentso the the pathway to the habenula andthen to these dopamine reducing circuitsare the pain pathway that we&amp;#39;rereferring to earlier it&amp;#39;s a genericpathway through which lots of differenttypes of signals and stimuli and eventscan punish us internally this is so gooddude and so i&amp;#39;m going to call this therich kid effectlike there and you mentioned hard workearlier there is a reason i think thatchildren of wealthy parents end upimploding because there is a anevolutionary the punishment pathwayevolutionary thing that&amp;#39;s going on thatsays you didn&amp;#39;t have to work hard forthe things that you own and because fromuh i need you to go hunt and gather andface a saber-toothed tiger i have toreward you for doing hard things andpunish you for not doing hard thingswell andyou know in the case of the thethe generic model of the of the spoiledrich kid it they actually can&amp;#39;t accessdopamine uh remember that that a moviefrom the 80s it was a uh it was calledlike the toy or something with richard iwas like if this [ __ ] says toyi&amp;#39;m gonna have a seizure yesrichard pryor in that movie and the kidhas everything and he&amp;#39;s the he&amp;#39;s theepitome of the spoiled brat all the toysall the cars all the things now we seethis with people who actually go fromrags to riches and then bathe in alltheir the luxuries they didn&amp;#39;t have as achild these are often the athletes thatdon&amp;#39;t go on to perform well againthese are people that crash because ofother dopamine-seeking behaviors youknow i&amp;#39;m not going to call out names butthere are far too many examples of theseand i don&amp;#39;t call out names mostlybecause we are all capable of this weall would like to think that oh if i hadall that money or if i had all thatsuccess i would really be a good humanbeing and i wouldn&amp;#39;t do those thingsanyone any human being that is immersedin these dopamine circuits too much orwho gets too much pleasure withouthaving to pursue it first and reallywork andactually experience pain pleasureratcheting back and forth along thatclimb because it wasn&amp;#39;t just dopaminelike this for you it&amp;#39;s probably painpleasure pain pleasure painpleasure pain right they&amp;#39;re alwaysproportional to one anotherso anyone that does that it has atremendously hard time accessingpleasurethey can&amp;#39;t do that and and we oftenthink about the extremes of addictionand those are really severe but we alsohave to think about the more subtleforms of something we really love butindulging in it just a little too oftenso that it no longer has that edgeyou know there have been really goodstudies of people who jump out ofairplanes with parachutes you knowi&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun it looks likea thrill but people do over and over andover againoften diedoing other things they often becomedrug addicts because it&amp;#39;s a huge high ohyeah yeah a lot of thatand you know there are a lot of examplesof this i mean you can get addicted toanything the key is to regulate thatbehavior so you asked whatyou know what should people do wellcertainlyi&amp;#39;m trying this now and i have some goodexamples some young people i know andwork with are taking breaks from notjust social media but no cell phonewhatsoever i&amp;#39;m actually trying an oddexperiment which isfor the first hour of every day no phonemostly because part of your 25 no-gosyesright so we have circuitry in the brainrelated to the so-called basal gangliaand we have go sort of activating youknow think gas pedal and then we there&amp;#39;sa lot of no go circuitryandlearning how to keep that no go don&amp;#39;tcircuitry as we could call ituh tuned up is very important and somany times throughout the day but i tryand get 25 a day where i activelyrefrain from doing something that iimpulsively want to do could be lookingat my phone but it could even besomething trivial like i want to walk tothe kitchen and get a glass of water soi&amp;#39;m actively engaging inself-denin denial not cognitive denial probablythat too but how would i know um but inaction-based denial so restricting mybehavior in some way as a way of keepingthese dopamine circuits tuned up alsonot looking at my phone first thing inthe morning for an hour becauseknowing what we now know about thesecond phase of sleep and rem sleepbeing more predominant the second waveof sleep and the fact that you&amp;#39;reworking through a lot of emotional andlogistical contingencies you&amp;#39;rereshaping your brain in sleep that&amp;#39;swhen neuroplasticity occurs during sleepit&amp;#39;s triggered in wakefulness but itactually takes place in sleep especiallythat second half of sleepwhen you wake up in the morning you arein a perfect position to what i callreceive the download of all the workthat your neural circuitry has beendoing the night before but if youimmediately go to a sensory experienceespecially a rich sensory experience ofstuff scrolling by you&amp;#39;re actuallymissing the information that youprocessed at night and even moreimportantly that second half of thenight during rem sleep is when theemotional weight of things start becomeslet&amp;#39;s sayyou put it on the shelf properly thingsthat are important to emotionalemotionally registered get put in oneshelf things that were like the commentyou got on twitter that was triggeringdoesn&amp;#39;t seem like such a big deal aftera good night&amp;#39;s sleep and that&amp;#39;s becausethat second half of sleep is actuallywhen you re-experience these things butyour body can&amp;#39;t secrete adrenaline it&amp;#39;skind of an internal form of therapy oreven trauma therapy and that&amp;#39;s whypeople who don&amp;#39;t get that sleep are veryyou know they&amp;#39;re easily agitated theyfeel like the world is crushing down onthem so when i wake up in the morning iwant to receive ideas that i want tolearn from my learning and if you takein new information you are not in aposition to do that and 60 minutes is atough one so i give myself two no-gosfor the 60-minute block if i can do itand i&amp;#39;ll tell you a lot of mornings ifail tom i don&amp;#39;t do it interesting ijust i found that shocking but i heardyou say that in another interview and iwas like well i mean i&amp;#39;m human you knowthere are mornings whereum i get enticed or worseworse i find myself reflexively pickingup without having made the consciousdecision and that&amp;#39;s wheni realized thatyou know we are alldeep in this process and i thinkuh we have to regulate it the theexperiment i&amp;#39;d like to do maybe you&amp;#39;lldo this with me as a challenge becausethe challenge is always good is in thenew year i actually want to take everyodd waking hour of the day off the phoneso even hours of the dayas long as it&amp;#39;s waking i&amp;#39;m willing tohave it on and work with it but oddhours just turn it off no matter whati don&amp;#39;t know if this will destroy mostof the relationshipsbut just to see can i do it on a rigidlyexternally imposed schedule because ifyou think about most of the growth inlife comes from these rigidly externallyimposed schedules and we hate thembut they are where we learn restraintdude this is so important i don&amp;#39;t knowif i hate them anymore so people willoften ask like how i do this that or theother whatever it is like tom how do youumso i work 93 hours a week that&amp;#39;s like myaverage that&amp;#39;s your average sotom why do you work 93 hours every weekand the answer is because 93 are joyfuland 94 wouldn&amp;#39;tandwhen i start working more than that itusually means that i&amp;#39;m juggling so manythings that my brain seems to be usingsleep as a way to track some of them orsomething yeah so i find myself wakingup a lot no i have a trick that allowsme to fall back asleep very fast butit&amp;#39;s still not as restful as justsleeping through the night what&amp;#39;s thetrick if you don&amp;#39;t mind me entering idon&amp;#39;t at all so i have two pairs ofairpod headphonesand i put them inand i put them on a uhfiction book and i turn the volume downsuch that if i don&amp;#39;t put a little bit ofpressure on my ear i can&amp;#39;t make out whatthey&amp;#39;re saying so as soon as i drift offthe pressure releases and i can stillhear that noise is being made but ican&amp;#39;t track it and so i&amp;#39;m usually outprobably in about three minutes wow thatthat changed my life in terms of when iget stressed i can still fall backasleep such a great skill and justreflecting on what you usethat murmur in the background and thiskind of low level i can&amp;#39;t quite detectit is actually the way that your braindetects things as you&amp;#39;re falling asleepso i wonder if you&amp;#39;ve triggered yourcircuit to run in reverse where youactually can send yourself back underwhat what it makes me think is that ican&amp;#39;tprocess the problemsand listen to a story at the same timeand so my brain clicks over into storymode and it&amp;#39;s like oh we&amp;#39;re digestingthis story i i&amp;#39;m getting input sobecause i&amp;#39;m getting input because it&amp;#39;sstory my brain lets go of i have tosolve problems and then that allows meto fall right back asleep that&amp;#39;s greatsuch a great skill and waking up in themiddle of the night from time to time touse the bathroom is actually quitenormaland some people are really obsessed bythe fact oh no i woke up and then theyget triggered but i learned this lastyear umthat thepeak in our alertness is actually about90 minutes before our natural bedtimeand a lot of people they you know theyreach the point in the evening wherethey&amp;#39;reready to go to sleep and then they feelall this you know excitement and surgeof energy and they think oh no i&amp;#39;m notgoing to be able to fall asleep butthat&amp;#39;s actually a natural surge that&amp;#39;sfollowed by a dip a lot of people alsohave the trouble of waking up in themiddle of the night and wondering whythey can&amp;#39;t fall back asleep this isdreadfully hard for a lot of people istruggled that for years yeah and one ofthe solutions is to go to bed earlierbecause it means that your melatonin isstarting to get released early in theevening and so we all have the naturalability to push to stay late stay uplater if we really need to this hasobvious adaptive utility but some peopleby who should go to bed quote unquoteshould go to bed at 9 or 10 p.m they&amp;#39;repushing to 11 or 12 and then theirmelatonin signal is starting to drop offnow they can&amp;#39;t fall asleepor they&amp;#39;re waking up at two or three inthe morning and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re introuble but it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve hitthe right schedule 93 hours is animpressive outputthat&amp;#39;s a lot of years of making anobscene amount of mistakes and to closethe loop on so people how do youaccomplish xyz and the answer is partlyrulesso you have to be obsessed with yourgoal right so for me that&amp;#39;s allobsessions start with a goal what do youwant is that thing exciting andhonorable assuming it&amp;#39;s exciting andhonorable there&amp;#39;s ways to like createfeedback loops which is largely whatwe&amp;#39;ve been talking about today aboutattaching the dopaminergic responsespecifically to the pursuit of thatthing rather than having itandbyto because i&amp;#39;m so excited and because iso believe in the reality of my goalsthat i actually could have them and thathaving them would be awesomei can create rules in my life and then ireally stick to those rules so once i&amp;#39;mvery careful about what rules i put inplace because i have to believe thatthey will actually lead me to this goalthat&amp;#39;s really exciting for me but if ibelieve it then i can put them in andthen also part of my identity is thati&amp;#39;m the type of person that when i set arule i follow it so i can create thisloop of like feeling good about myselfand the thing that i&amp;#39;m pursuing but itreally works and i&amp;#39;m shocked how fewpeople have the kind of rule that you&amp;#39;retalking about in the new year to say heyi&amp;#39;m only going to do odd hours there&amp;#39;sno phone yeah well and like i said i&amp;#39;mnot perfect i&amp;#39;m not as disciplined asyou are about my no goes i try iactually find that tabulating is is kindof funum it&amp;#39;s also fun to get reallytriggering commentsand and to not close the dopamine loopfor them i think if people understood umthe dopamine reward prediction errorthat we could end all the umamplifying comment battles onlinebecause what happens is if someone takesa a jab at you of any kind there&amp;#39;sactually an open dopamine loop waitingfor you to respond and any responseactually gives them that that dopamineresponse of success it&amp;#39;s a little bit ofa it&amp;#39;s like scoring a three-pointer andthe no response actually drops theirdopamine below baseline and that&amp;#39;s itsown form of retaliation and i have to becareful because i don&amp;#39;t want toencourage people to retaliate but anyanything that short-circuits the kind ofmadness of getting pulled intosome online battle that&amp;#39;s totallymeaningless it&amp;#39;s taking people away fromother powerful good things that theycould do in the worldyou know we&amp;#39;ve been talking mainly aboutdopamine and its scheduling and aboutthe fact that it can be attached toanything i thinkmany people find it hard to subjectivelyattach dopamine to something they don&amp;#39;twant to do this is something that uh ifwe&amp;#39;d spoken a year ago i would&amp;#39;ve i myanswer would have been a little bitdifferent to the question of how do youget motivated well one way to do that isif you are good at subjectivelyattachingdopamine to the pursuit just knowingokay i really am hungry for this i&amp;#39;mjust i&amp;#39;m going to tell myself that youknow making you know making it onepercent of the wayis a success and i&amp;#39;m going to keep goingand i&amp;#39;m going to keep ratcheting on andthat&amp;#39;s great if you can do that but forpeople that can&amp;#39;t do that understandingthis relationship with a pleasure painbalance can be more powerful justunderstanding the more friction and painthat you experience the greater thedopamine reward you will get later andthat serves as its own amplifier of thewhole process of pursuing more dopamineand then the other aspect of itis that any time that we&amp;#39;re leaning intoactionyou know it has thepossibility of being an amplifyingprocess or a depleting processand the key to that is making sure thatyou&amp;#39;re balancing the dopamine andepinephrine systems you know epinephrinebeing this molecule of universalcurrency of energy output it could beout of hate or it could be out of loveepinephrine doesn&amp;#39;t care and actuallydopamine doesn&amp;#39;t care none of thesesystems care about us they justwork underneath our underneath ourconscious control but when you start tounderstand thathitting the gas pedal is great buthitting the gas pedal and then comingoff the gas pedal a little bityou can kind of sit in a more relaxedrpm actually allows you to go muchfurther i think that peopleleaning into action is terrific i alwayssay you can either be back on your heelsflat footed or forward center of massthe best situation is actually to beright upright but just know that you canbe forward center of mass at any pointand you know that to take it back to sexand reproduction because it&amp;#39;s a salientexample the arc of of sex is veryinteresting because when you think aboutautonomic arousal it turns out that thethe arousal stage of sex actuallyinvolves release of dopaminebut is what we call parasympatheticdominant it&amp;#39;s actually has to be relaxedenoughin order to occur okay everyone can readbetween the lines on thisorgasm is actuallyai want to say full blown it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s ait is a sympatheticnervous system driven response it&amp;#39;sidentical to the stress system it&amp;#39;sdriven by the same neural circuits asstressand then what comes afterwardthe parasympathetic system goes back upagain it&amp;#39;s that deep relaxation so whydo i say this not to talk about sex tobeyou know to to serve as a highlighterbut rather our species arrived herebecause of this dance between arousaland relaxation arousal and relaxationand one thing we can say for sure aboutevery human being that&amp;#39;s alive now isthat their parents at least oncemastered this dance of relaxed but notand excited but not too excited thenreally excited and then relaxed thatdance was mastered by all of our parentsand that&amp;#39;s what delivered us here tosome extent and so iwhat this means is that all the neuralcircuits from the ones that led to ourconception to the ones that lead to uspursuing goals have thisbalance that&amp;#39;s almost like a like aseesaw right there&amp;#39;s activation and calmactivation and calm and it&amp;#39;s thatdynamic process that&amp;#39;s important tomaster in every endeavor so we use sexas an example but in pursuit of goalsyou have to learn how to pursueshort-term goalsand like the goals within the day make acup of coffee and goal and long-termgoals and when i said dopamine is what&amp;#39;ssetting theyour time perception it&amp;#39;s an intervaltimerwhat you&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s like the twomarshmallow experiment done at stanforddef defer the dopamineand actually if you can turn the waitinginto the dopamine and thenyou can extend out the reward for youknow waiting for the second marshmallow15 minutes later et cetera et cetera andthere are many many examples of this inthe psychology and neuroscienceliterature and i would say finally in2020 we finally as a field got a clearidea of how dopamine is really workingbecause before it was all aboutwork dopamine hit rightsex gives you a doubling hit theinternet gives you a dopamine what wedidn&amp;#39;t realize is that repeatedengagement with these things leads todopamine depletionand that the pain and pleasure balanceis always at workdude that&amp;#39;s so brilliant dudeone the huberman lab is amazing onyoutube people need to check that [ __ ]out and your instagram page is alsoamazingwhere do you want people to follow youat yeah so well thanks um for those kindwords um yes i mean them so aggressivelyi&amp;#39;ll bite through the camera to letpeople know how seriously i mean thatthank you yeah so i i have an instagrampage it&amp;#39;s huberman lab and there i teachneuroscience in anywhere from one minuteto you know five minute tidbits and alot of actionable tools that relate toall sorts of things sleep and motivationetc and then the huberman lab podcast isapple spotify and we have a youtubechannel for people want to watch andlisten to it and they&amp;#39;reit&amp;#39;s a little bit different than mostpodcasts because i will do four episodesall on one general theme like food andthe brainand these are longhour to two hour long lectures where ijust kind of blab on and on myself butthey&amp;#39;re all time stamps so people canget information there and it&amp;#39;s tools andscience and then we have great guests onwho are expert in their fields peoplelike anna lemke um luminaries and theyou know

brainresearching you is one of my favoritethings to do the breadth of topics thatyou cover is incrediblenone more so than the fact that we canget to our mind through our body which ithink is one of the most incrediblethings before we started rolling thoughi had this whole interview planned iknew exactly where we were going to goand then you made a comment i wasbringing up bitcoin and uhcryptocurrency as i do because i&amp;#39;mobsessed and you said well there&amp;#39;s onlyone biological currency and that&amp;#39;sdopamine that&amp;#39;s right and i was likewell now i know where we&amp;#39;re startingwhat do you mean by that yeah so youknow human beings have evolved tons oftechnologiesand currenciesbitcoin ethereum are not topics i know alot a lot about but when you think aboutdollar euro bitcoin ethereum you thinkabout wins and lossesin sport in life in relationship andanything something in your brain andbody has to keep track of that did youwin did you lose what&amp;#39;s a letdown what&amp;#39;sa celebration andi think one of the most importantfindings in the last few years inneuroscience is thatwhile the molecule dopamine isassociated with rewardit&amp;#39;s more aboutmotivation and cravingthere&amp;#39;s a really classic experiment nowthat people use to demonstrate this taketwo ratsand the rats independently separatecages can lever pressfor fooduh when they can access foodthere&amp;#39;s a little bit of dopamine that&amp;#39;sreleased anytime they get some food sowe always thought that foodlike many other rewardslike food sex warmth when you&amp;#39;re coldcool when you&amp;#39;re too warmis triggering the release of dopaminebutsomeone had the good idea to depletedopamine in one of those animalsand then what you find is that theanimal withoutdopamine still enjoys foodstill enjoys other pleasures so dopamineis not really involved in the enjoymentof those pleasures it&amp;#39;s involved inmotivation because if you make theanimal have to move just one rat&amp;#39;slengthbelieve it or not to get to that leverthe animal with dopamine will work to goget that thing it will work through someeffort to go get the reward whereas theanimal or turns out the human withoutmuch dopaminecan still experience pleasure they cansit on their couch and cram their facewith pleasure inducing calories or whathave you watch pleasure-inducing thingson the television but they have verylittle motivation to go pursue thingsthat will deliver them pleasureso when i say dopamine is the universalcurrencyofeverything what i mean is it&amp;#39;s drivingthe motivation to develop new currencieswhen somebody can sit back and say uhi&amp;#39;ll just throw this number out let&amp;#39;ssay somebody has a hundred thousandbitcoins which presumably now is worthoh my godcertainly more than it was a few yearsagothe way they can register whether or notthey are in a position of wealth or nothas everything to do with the the numberthey see on the screen or in theirbitcoin walletbutthat number is converted into a chemicalsignal that has everything to do withhow much you had previously so so wecould talk about the so-called rewardprediction error how good you feel withan experience has everything to do withhow muchyou had previouslyand dopamine itself is what&amp;#39;s drivingthe human species tocreate these new technologies and sowhile we think of currencies as the goalit&amp;#39;s actually what&amp;#39;s really driven theforward evolution of our our species hasbeen the desire to go seek things beyondthe confines of our skin and when i saythe common currency is dopamine what imean is the molecule dopamine whensecreted in the brain makes us pursuethings build things create things makesus want new things that we don&amp;#39;tcurrently already have and so it has alot of dimensions to it but rather thanthink about dopamine as a signal forreward like a dopamine hit weclassically think to talk about it it&amp;#39;smore accurate really to think aboutdopamine as driving motivation andcraving to go seek rewards that&amp;#39;s therad experiment and it&amp;#39;s a way oftabulating where we are in our life arewe doing well or are we doing poorly andthat happens on very short time scaleslike do you wake up feeling good or doyou wake up feeling kind of loworon long time scales if you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough a long degree or you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough your life how are you doing howdo you gauge that well it has everythingto do with how much dopamine you werereleasing in the previous days and weeksand years so you&amp;#39;re always comparing andall of this is subconscious but what&amp;#39;scool is that once you make theseprocesses conscious once you understanda little bit about how dopamine isreleased and how it changes ourperspective and our behavior then youcan actually work with it so it&amp;#39;s one oftheum instances where knowledge ofknowledge actually turns out to be areally useful tooldude that&amp;#39;s crazy to me so one of thethings that i get hit up about all thetime ispeople feel stuckand as you like really push on them tofigure out why they feel stuck they&amp;#39;llbe like yeah i want to do that and but ijust you know i can&amp;#39;t get out of bed ori don&amp;#39;t have the energy to pursue it orwhatever andyou get into thiscommon thing that people say in mindsetand i really believe it but i find itfar more interesting when you&amp;#39;re talkingabout it from a neuro chemicalstandpoint which is you just don&amp;#39;t wantit badly enoughand when i think aboutmy own life i sometimes worrythat i&amp;#39;m either more malleable thanother people or that i have a greaterability to manipulate my dopaminerelease or whateverbecause i&amp;#39;m very good at building desireand i like the way that desire feels nowwhen you use the word hunger i thinkpeople get confused because i actuallydon&amp;#39;t enjoy being hungry for food i findthat totally unpleasurablehowever being hungry for sex i findincredibly i feel alive i feel focused ifeel energized i feel aggressive it&amp;#39;scomplex for sure but i find that feelingincred the the act of wanting somethingin the future in in that kind or inbusiness and trying to build somethingi&amp;#39;ve in fact that&amp;#39;s an interestinginsight into my own selfabouti like to buildanddo we know so we dopamine is theneurochemistry of the pursuit of makingsure that i have the energy to go but dowe know how we can spike thatwell first of all it&amp;#39;s clear to me basedon your description that you&amp;#39;ve tappedinto theseuh channels that release dopaminebecause craving and wanting whether ornot it&amp;#39;s sex or or uh money orconnectionor anything all right uh is that&amp;#39;s thethe primary trigger for dopamine releaseyeah now sex and reproduction makes themost sense from the perspective ofevolution uh i mean any species everyspecieshas tends to have two primary goals oneprotect it&amp;#39;s young and second make moreof itself usually in reverse order rightso even for people that don&amp;#39;t wantchildren i mean you might not or peopleof course not everyone is having sexjust to reproduce but at a primordiallevel that&amp;#39;s what those circuits arethere for so every species in particularmammalian species where there&amp;#39;s a lot ofparenting and caretakingof the youngtries to take make more of itself andeverything that you see like maternalaggression which is a powerful circuitthat gets activated afterfemales of any species in particularmammals give birth they will fight tothe death and they gain superhumanstrength in order to protect their youngthat&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a known circuit forthat in the brain that gets activatedonce a female has offspringand it&amp;#39;s robustinside tracker is offering our listeners25 off their entire store includinginner age 2.0 just visitinsidetracker.comimpact theory all right

you&amp;#39;re one it&amp;#39;ll besuper interesting because you&amp;#39;ll know ifshe&amp;#39;s on the right track from aneuroscience perspective i rememberreading the book at the time i thought iwas going to have kidsand i remember thinking whoa like thisbook chronicles what happens to awoman&amp;#39;s brain and how things change andi was like when you have kids man youare inviting aneurochemical change in your significantother that is going to play itself outin a very real way and i&amp;#39;d be lying if isaid that wasn&amp;#39;t one of the things oneof the many things but one of the thingsthat i factored into not having kidsinteresting uh and then the same withmenopause that it&amp;#39;s this really dramaticsort of reorganizing might not be theright word but that it it has realimplications in theway that the person moves just as thedecline of testosterone has in men wellin on aon the positive sideduring pregnancy the woman&amp;#39;s hippocampusher brain area associated with memoryand retention of information it goesthrough a period in which it gets worsefor certain types of information butthen achieves superior levels of workingmemory oncethe babies arrive because there are alot of things to manage so this makessense this is true in rodents this istrue in humans and then in terms of thebiology of the father we now know thatwhen because typically parents have uhyou know does seem like one spousealways does more than the otherbut even in the most evenly dividedhouseholdsthe there&amp;#39;s usually some co-parenting ofsome sort but that the father has abig increase in the hormone prolactinwhenthe mother is expecting and theprolactin lays down body fat it preparesfor sleepless nights for women it itsparks um the circuitry for milk letdownfor for nursingso the dad bod has a lot to do withprolactin this is true in in birds insmall mammals and in humans and this isnow there was a paper published innatureon humans specifically about this andwhen you think about the relationshipbetween dopamine and prolactin it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;sinteresting and it takes us back to thismotivation and craving that you weredescribing earlier which is thatdopamine and prolactin work in inopposite fashionso the the most salient example of thisis sex and reproduction whereanticipation of sex and reproductiongreatly increases dopaminebut postsreproductivepost-sex it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be forreproduction there&amp;#39;s a spark inprolactin in the mail that&amp;#39;s the spikeexcuse me in prolactin and that spike inprolactin is actually what sets therefractory period during which he can&amp;#39;tmate again so it sets a period ofquiescence to keepmen it&amp;#39;s repair bonding for the exchangeof chemicals through the nose to thethrough the skin and through the sweatmainly through odor uh we could talkabout pheromones if you want but that&amp;#39;sa topic that&amp;#39;s somewhat controversialthe actual identity of pheromones inhumans has not been identified but thereare pheromone effects in humanscontroversial in that people don&amp;#39;t agreewhat&amp;#39;s really happening well okay sothere&amp;#39;s this culture of biologists thathave clearly identifiedpheromone effects in other in non-humansand non-human primatesbut whether or not those arethe classic definition of a pheromoneeffect is that it&amp;#39;s subconscious thatyou can&amp;#39;t actually detect the smellhowever we know that smells themselvesconscious detection of them can evokevery robust physiological responses oneone example to just stay in this arenaof of of thought is that a guy by thename of gnome sobel who&amp;#39;s at theweizmann institute he used to be atberkeley he has a lab over in israel hisamazing lab works on olfactionsmell and they discovered that the scentof women&amp;#39;s tears causes a dramatic andsignificant reduction in testosterone inmen what absolutely and this waspublished if anyone wants to go look itup it was published in science magazineyou know you can smell tears yeah wehave you know the super bowl ofpublishing and science is science natureand self those are the three topjournals this is published in sciencemagazine very stringent uh the smell oftears now it&amp;#39;s subconscious at somelevelbut the other thing that if we weregoing to kind of play around in thishormones and behave interactions betweenhumans um there are some reallyinteresting examples so for instancemenwill rate the smell of a woman&amp;#39;s skin orsweat or the perception of her face asmore beautiful during the pre-ovulatoryphase of her menstrual cyclethat pre-ovulatory phase is associatedwith a number of different changes inhormones okayjust that smell will increasetestosterone in a maleoral contraception in the femalewomen taking oral contraception itadjusts their hormones such that men nolonger detect this change inhow attractive women are doesn&amp;#39;t meanthey find them unattractive but it meansthey don&amp;#39;t find them increasinglyinteractive during this certain periodof the of their of their menstrual cycleso we are constantly signaling back andforth through hormones in fact we metover thereand shook hands because we&amp;#39;ve beentested for covet and the rest we shookhands andwhat happened and what happens within 30seconds of any human being contactingone another is they shake hands and thenthey wipe their the chemicals of theother person on their facegnome&amp;#39;s lab has also shown this and sowe are constantly signaling throughthrough chemical exchange sometimes it&amp;#39;ssubconscious and those are the so-calledpheromone effects sometimes it&amp;#39;s lowlevels of odors that are beneath ourconscious detection and sometimes it&amp;#39;soutright wow this person smells reallyreally good or they look particularlygood today oftentimes that&amp;#39;s tied to theof the period in which they areovulating in their menstrual cycle so iwant to plant a flag here about all thethings that we dothat aremessing with these mechanisms likecologne or deodorant or oralcontraception of which i&amp;#39;m not saying ispornography like all interception hasserved a great role in it for certainpeople some people might say was this anethical discussion or is it good is itbad but um either way it is having aneffect right so to remove i only look atthings through the lens of biology notthrough the lens of of whether or not weshould or shouldn&amp;#39;t do things i love itokay so we&amp;#39;re planning that we&amp;#39;re comingback to it but now i want to get to howdo we spike intentionally you&amp;#39;ve talkedabout we can spike testosterone but iwant to know can we spike dopamineyeah so um and you&amp;#39;ve done this so yourexample ofcraving isactually what you crave you crave thefeeling of craving is beautiful becauseit would what it means is that you don&amp;#39;tallow yourself to go so far down the arcof the dopamine trajectory to get to theother source of motivation so there aretwo sources of motivation as it relatesto dopamine and then we can think abouttools that we could export from thesethat are nested in neurobiologythe first is to do what you dowhich is to be able to sense the cravingas its own form of pleasure this haskind of remnants of carol dweck&amp;#39;s growthmindset that you eventually develop apleasure in the seeking and the strivinghas you know uh has flavors of a davidgoggins type approach where where itseems like he gets pleasure from thefriction itself and so there areelements of that you seem to have thatas wellbutif you can start to identify the cravingas its own internally released drug thisthing dopamine that is a source ofmotivation then what you realize is thatcapturing the reward is wonderfulbut attaching dopamine to the reward isactually a little bit dangerousattaching yeah this is celebrating thewin celebrating the win more than thepursuit it actually sets you up forfailure in the future and so this getsus right into something called dopaminereward prediction error and rewardprediction error is basically if youexpect something to be really greatand then it&amp;#39;s not quite that great yourdopamine baseline lowers and nowunderstanding what we know aboutdopamine that means that not only didyou you feel as if you lost because itwasn&amp;#39;t as much a celebration as youthought it would be but it also meansthat you&amp;#39;re starting from a lower placemeaning you are less motivated now thesimpler way to conceptualize this ishave a colleague at stanford she runsthe addiction dual diagnosis clinic atuh her name is dr anna lemke she has abook called dopamine nation that&amp;#39;s outright nowand she&amp;#39;s really described as pleasurepain balance where anytime you have abunch of dopamine and you&amp;#39;re in pursuitpursuit pursuitafter you achieve a win now this couldbe a business win a relationship a winof any kindbutinevitably there&amp;#39;s going to be a tippingback of the scale on the pain side andthat pain side is always going to go alittle bit higher than the dopamine sideso this is what you would feel if youpursued a goal like building a bigcompanyhere it comes here comes the big saleand then there&amp;#39;s the well what now thekind of letdown now if you wait if yousimply wait and stop pursuing dopaminefor a short while the scale starts toresetthe problem is a lot of peopleimmediately roll right into the nextpursuitand then what happens is that scalestarts to get stuck on the pain side alittle bit more a little bit more alittle bit more and pretty soon noamount of seeking will allow you toexperience that craving and motivationso what what does this mean in terms ofan actual tool well first of allif people can do what you do they&amp;#39;regoing to be in a much better position inlife it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s schoolsport relationship any domain of life ifyou can start to register ah thatcraving and that friction and thatdesire that almost kind of low level ofagitation sometimes high level ofagitation that is that i&amp;#39;m trying toimpose my will on the world in abenevolent way we hopethat&amp;#39;s dopamine it&amp;#39;s working with itsclose cousin which is epinephrine whichis adrenaline they are very closecousins in fact dopamine manufacturesepinephrine a lot of people don&amp;#39;t knowthis but adrenaline is actually madefrom the molecule dopamineokay so those two are hanging outtogether it&amp;#39;s like crave work crave workcraving work craving work craving workand then you get the winand some peopleallow the big peak in dopamine to beassociated with the winandsmart peoplelearn to adjust their celebrationinternally right this is all internalyou could throw the biggest party in theworld but as long as you&amp;#39;re kind of inlaid backandlooking at this not letting yourself getmanic crazyyou won&amp;#39;t necessarily crash as hardand pretty soon your system will resetso you take the day you clean up thedishes you relax you go what now i&amp;#39;mfeeling a little low well rather thangoing out and spiking your dopamineagain just wait understand that thescale will reset again give yourself afew days where you&amp;#39;re going to feel alittle kind of underwhelmed thingsaren&amp;#39;t going to be as interestingit&amp;#39;s going to be hard to trigger thatbig release because you just hadthe peakwell if you adjust that you relax youunderstand there&amp;#39;s always a little bitof a postpartum depressionwe sometimes hear about postpartumdepression that&amp;#39;s a clinical thing butthere&amp;#39;s always that kind of today&amp;#39;s notas excitingas the previous days what am i going todo with my life but thenif you let it start ratcheting up againthen what you realize is your capacityto tap into dopamine as a motivator notjust seeking dopamine rewards that isinfinite and i i can say with with greatcertainty that this ishow you were able to build a big companyand sell it how you&amp;#39;ve been able tobuild a successful podcast and sell ithow you constantly seeking becauseseeking is the reward and i think formost people we think of the reward asthe finish line and so the key is to getto the finish line step into the endzone but no end zone dance it&amp;#39;s justlike yep and now i&amp;#39;m gonna go do itagainthat&amp;#39;s really the key that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s thekey to doing it over and over and when isee big athletes oracademics or anyone or musicians andtheyrise and crashit&amp;#39;s clear they&amp;#39;ve lost the touch withthe motivation evoked dopamine andthey&amp;#39;ve lost touch probably because ithasn&amp;#39;t really been described by theneuroscience community until anna hasstarted talking about this stuffpublicly and i&amp;#39;m just kind of echoingwhat she&amp;#39;s beautifully saidsaid much better than i am which is thatyou should always expect that after abunch of pleasure there&amp;#39;s going to bethat low and then that craving how do iget back to there again and the key isyou have to walk the staircase again youdon&amp;#39;t get to do this as a square wavepull you know you don&amp;#39;t get to justascend ascend ascend it&amp;#39;s always updownup a little bit higher down up you knowit&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the functionso um i don&amp;#39;t know if that resonateswith your experience i&amp;#39;m over herefreaking out so you&amp;#39;ve literally justexplained what i will say is the singlemost important loop if you want to besuccessfuland you used wordsattach right you had another one whichwas about your t i forget the exact wordbut you&amp;#39;re taking you&amp;#39;re insertingyourself consciously into the processbecause what i learned very early on andi&amp;#39;m so grateful in the same way that youare grateful that your upbringing wasn&amp;#39;tperfect but it ended up giving you aframe of reference and insights thathave propelled you forward i&amp;#39;m verygrateful that i spent a decade justtrying to get rich that was the statedmission i would say it every day likei&amp;#39;m here to get rich i show up to workto get rich it&amp;#39;s about getting rich richrich rich and it didn&amp;#39;t workand so and my wife pulls me aside andshe&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re now damaging themarriage like you&amp;#39;re just so fiendishlyfocused on the goalthat there&amp;#39;s nothing as integrated inyour life you&amp;#39;re doing something youhate for an end state that may nevercomeand that was so profound and it shook meso deeply and it suddenly became clearthat from a neurological perspectivewhat i wanted was to feel alive and oncei put everything in the pursuit i&amp;#39;m justinterested in can i show up every dayand sincerely pursue this thing which imay never get but i&amp;#39;m gonna honor myselfcelebrate myself big up myself as thebrits would say for just showing uptoday and actually trying to make ithappenand one that&amp;#39;s way more sustainable andthen two you don&amp;#39;tyou don&amp;#39;t get tricked into thinking thatoh when i get this thing that i&amp;#39;ll feelgood because it&amp;#39;s the craving that makesme feel alive so it&amp;#39;s the state ofwanting that is in and of itself thepleasurable act that&amp;#39;s right and soi began to use the metaphor of i&amp;#39;m gonnaclimb this mountain only to want thenext mountain to climb and once i knewthat well then you have to be totallycomfortable dropping back down andstarting all over now the interestingthing and i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m foolingmyself or if i haveso integrated that trickbut the come down isn&amp;#39;t hard for me soi i think my last day at quest was amondayand tuesday i started impact theory andso that went from i had 3 000 employeesyour position matters you get a lot ofdeference uh you&amp;#39;ve got a privilegedparking space you know what i mean likethere&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that gointo it andbut i didn&amp;#39;t none of like my rewardsystem was tied to that so it was veryeasy for me to start the next day withthere was only seven of us and no onehad time for any deference of any kindand i went from having an ea which youcan&amp;#39;t imagine how amazing that is to notand you&amp;#39;re doing everything for yourselfagainbut that wasn&amp;#39;t a painful thing becausei was so focused on all right cool thisis step one again and now can can werepeat well it helps if you can expectthat there will be a little bit of a dippost win or postwhatever um that&amp;#39;s helpful there&amp;#39;salways a refractory period of any kindso to speak if you expect it that&amp;#39;sgreat because you eliminate the thedownside of the reward prediction errorreward prediction error can also beconceptualized as i tell you we&amp;#39;re goingto go this restaurant i keep building upthe food building up the food i actuallyraised the expectation and therequirement that that food be reallyspectacular better off i just tell youit&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty good and thenyou&amp;#39;re wowed by it right because if yourdopamine was higher in anticipation thanthe actual food evoked well then itmakes sense why would you&amp;#39;re alwaysintegrating over the dopamine releaseyou had previouslynow there are a couple things that yousaid in there that i want to highlightwhich i find so interesting uh and wecan get a little biteastern philosophy mystical here but tieit back to some real neuroscience whichis you said you know that&amp;#39;s the juicethe motivation is the juice you knowthatif you look at eastern philosophy andthey talk about qi you know in this youknow what is that i i wager that isdopamine the desire to pursue things andto create more of oneself andas a species whether or not you decideto have kids or not those circuits alluse the one universal currency dopamineof wanting more things that are outsidethe confines of your skin and that&amp;#39;swhat&amp;#39;s driven forward evolution ofindividuals andfamilies and cultures and our ourspecies as a whole and again thecircuitry has been there for many manytens if not hundreds of thousands ofyearsand so it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s highly conservedand so what that means is that itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s bitcoin orethereum it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;sputting rockets on other planets itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s building thefirst automobile it&amp;#39;s the same currencyso understanding those cycles is reallykey the other thing is the element ofpain i think that understanding thatpain and pleasure and this reallydynamic balancecan also help us which in the followingwayany pain that you feel the longer daythe less sleep the the kind of agonythat things aren&amp;#39;t working that poweroutlet doesn&amp;#39;t work or the internet isslow whatever it isthe amount of pleasure that you willeventually experienceis directly relation related excuse meto how much pain you experience so weknow this from actually what nowadayswould be considered quite barbaric andunethical experiments where they wouldgive people electrical shocksand they would measure their responseand then they&amp;#39;d say we&amp;#39;re going toincrease it we&amp;#39;re going to increase iteventually they get to the point where aslight shock that was previously verypainful actually evokes a sense ofpleasurenow you couldn&amp;#39;t do these experimentsanymore these are not the experiments ido in my labthese are older experiments butfor instance and this has been discussedin scientific research papers uh givingsomebody a like a 10-minute ice bath forinstance or even a three-minute ice bathor a one-minute ice bath it&amp;#39;s quitepainful but there was a study from theuniversity of prague uh european journalphysiology showed that after a painfulice bath stimulusthe amount of dopamine release goes upfor two and a half hours to 250 percentabove baseline and that&amp;#39;s not becausethe ice bathitself evokes dopamine release a lot ofpeople think oh cold water of oxdopamine release no pain evokes dopaminerelease after the pain is over yesterdayi tweaked my back because i do thisstupid thing every few years the samestupid thing and it&amp;#39;s really painful andthen you just remember all the ways inwhich you can&amp;#39;t move around i was likestanding up this morning like ah andjust walking is so painful as the painhas started to dissipate you get alittle bit of a high right you get alittle bit of a euphoria that&amp;#39;s dopaminebecause of the the degree of pain youexperienced previously predicts how muchpleasure so when you start a companydown in the dregs and you&amp;#39;re shovelingagainthat&amp;#39;s beautiful because that means thatthe wind that you achieveis going to be as good or greater thanthe one you had previously in your casewith quest and so we go back to thisexample the person that&amp;#39;s not motivatedthat can&amp;#39;t get off the couch thatdoesn&amp;#39;t want to do anything well this isthe problem we remember the radexperiment they are effectively the ratwith no dopamine but they can stillachievesome sense of pleasureby consuming excess calories byconsuming social media and look i&amp;#39;m notjudging i do this stuff too rightscrolling social media if you&amp;#39;ve everscrolled social media and you&amp;#39;re like idon&amp;#39;t even know why i&amp;#39;m doing this itdoesn&amp;#39;t really feel that goodand i can remember a time where you&amp;#39;dsee something it was just so cool or yousee something online i remember thiswhen ted talks first came out i was likethis is amazing these are some at leastsome of them are really smart peoplesharing really cool insights and thennow that they&amp;#39;re like a gazillion tedtalks i remember spending a winter in myoffice at when i was a junior professorcleaning my office finallyand binging ted talks in the backgroundthinking this is a good use of my timepretty soon they all sucked to me i waslike this isn&amp;#39;t good so what you need todo is stop watching dead docs for awhilewait and then they become interestingagain and that&amp;#39;s this pain pleasurebalanceand so for people that aren&amp;#39;t feelingmotivated the problem is they&amp;#39;re notmotivated but they&amp;#39;re getting justenough or excess sustenance so they&amp;#39;regetting the little mild hits of opioidit becomes an opioid system and if youthink about the opioid drugs as opposedto dopamine dopaminergic drugsdopaminergic drugs make people rabid foreverything you know drugs of abuse likecocaine amphetamine make peopleincredibly outward directed or theyhardly notice anything except what theywant more of more more it&amp;#39;s veryit&amp;#39;s badbecause those drugs trigger so muchdopamine release that they become thereward it&amp;#39;s very circular that only thedrug can give that much dopamine nothingthey could pursue would give them asmuch dopamine as the drug itselfso there&amp;#39;s that and then there&amp;#39;s thekind of opioid like effectsof constantly indulging oneself withsocial media or with video games or withwith food or with anything to the pointwhere it no longer evokes the motivationand craving and this is really the newevolution of the understanding ofdopamine and neuro in neuroscience whichis that dopamine itself is not thereward it&amp;#39;s the build-up to the rewardand the reward has more of a kind ofopioid bliss-like property which itselfis not bad if it&amp;#39;s endogenous releasedfrom within but when we can just sitthere like the like the rat with nodopamine gorging ourselves withpleasures so to speak what you end upwith is somebody that feels reallyunmotivated and those pleasures nolonger work to tickle those feel-goodcircuits and so there&amp;#39;s no reason forthem to go out and pursue anything andthat&amp;#39;s a pretty dark picture so the thekeys areto pursue rewards but understand thatthe pursuit is actually the rewardif you want to have repeatedwins okay you the celebration has to beless than the pursuit and that&amp;#39;s hardfor some people to dothey you know they it&amp;#39;s got to be thatyour celebration is slightly lessdopaminergicit can be very reflective you can be ingratitude those are otherneurotransmitter systems but you don&amp;#39;twant to be on that high as you celebratethe windyou want to betrickling out your dopamineregularly until you pursue things andthen just understand there will alwaysbe a crash of pain and the more pain youexperience the more dopamine you canachieve if you get back on the avenue ofperfect yeah this gets into unintendedconsequences of modernity and so we&amp;#39;reliving through this time where we youknow going back to that flag that weplanted of these unintended consequencesof oh i can make myself smell good oh ican you know watch the coolest video ohlike tick tockdude i don&amp;#39;t have an addictivepersonality that&amp;#39;s the first thing wherei&amp;#39;ll lose an hour and be like what the[ __ ] did i just do well that&amp;#39;sthe problem is not pleasures the problemis that pleasure experienced withoutprior requirement for pursuit yesisterrible for us it&amp;#39;s terrible for us asindividuals it&amp;#39;s terrible for us as asgroups and i have great confidence inthe human species to work this out butwe are finding now and we are going toincreasingly find that those who will besuccessful young or old are going to bethose people who can create their owninternal buffers they&amp;#39;re going to beable to control their relationship topleasures because the proximity topleasures and their availability is theproblem if you look atthe increase inuse of drugs of abuse or prescriptionmedication which at least at the firstpass deliver pleasure pain relief thewhole issue with the opioid crisis andand dopaminergic drugs like ritalinadderallyou know there is sometimes there&amp;#39;s aclinical need but tons of people aretaking those recreationally now or tostudy huge dopamine increases are whatthose causethat is a problem that&amp;#39;s a seriousproblem because it creates a cycle whereyou you need more of that specific thingi always say addictionis a progressive narrowing of the thingsthat bring you pleasure that&amp;#39;s such agood difference and you know and i don&amp;#39;tlike to comment too much onenlightenment because you know i don&amp;#39;treally know what that is as aneurobiologist but a good life we couldsay is a progressive expansion of thethings that bring you pleasure and evenbetter is a good life is a progressiveexpansion of the things that bring youpleasure and includes pleasure throughmotivation and hard work andunderstanding this pain pleasure balancewhereby if you experience pain and youcan continue to be in that friction andexert effortthe rewards are that much greater whenthey arriveand soi think that if you look at any drug ofabuse or any situation where somebodyisn&amp;#39;t motivated or thinks that now theymay have clinically diagnosed attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder but a lotof what people think is adhd it turnsout is people just over consumingdopamine from various sources and thenand also the context within a tick tockfeed is the context switch is insane thebrain has never seen first of allthere&amp;#39;s a first time in human evolutionthat we wrote with our thumbs but that&amp;#39;sa pretty benign shift and that the othershift isnormally you walk from one room toanother or from a field into the treesor from a hut into or a house orwhatever it is but now you can get 10000 context switches in that 30 minutesof scrolling on instagram or to talk andso it&amp;#39;s all about self-regulation we aregoing to select for the people that canself-regulate andso then people say well how do youself-regulate how do kids self-regulatewell this is my hope and one of thereasons i&amp;#39;ve gotten excited about publiceducation and teaching neuroscience isthatthis is a place where knowledge ofknowledge actually can allow oneself tointervene when you think i&amp;#39;m feeling lowi don&amp;#39;t feel good nothing really feelslike am i depressed maybe but maybeyou&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;ve saturated thedopamine circuits you&amp;#39;re now in the painpart of things what do you do well youhave to stop you need you need toreplenish dopamine you need to stopengaging with this behavior and thenyour pleasure for it will come back butyou have to constantly control the hingeit&amp;#39;s not just about being back and forthon the seesaw you have to make sure thehinge doesn&amp;#39;t get stuck in pain or inpleasure so it&amp;#39;s a dynamic process beinga human being it&amp;#39;s not easy and rememberthese circuits didn&amp;#39;t evolve for thispurposethey evolve primarily formaking more of ourselves that&amp;#39;s whythey&amp;#39;re so closely tied to thereproductive circuits and that&amp;#39;s why itwas interesting and very relevant thatyou said that yourdesire to have sex with your wife is oneof the most powerful feelings and itkind of as a from a neurochemicalperspective it wicks out into all theseother pursuits right those otherpursuits aren&amp;#39;t about sex per se butit&amp;#39;s the same molecules so the feelingis the same it&amp;#39;s just that some peoplefor some people the amplitude of thatdopamine signal for craving sex is veryhigh for some people that&amp;#39;s lower andit&amp;#39;s higher for um video games you knowwhatever you lean intoand and youthink about oftenin these pursuits we&amp;#39;ll start to reshapethese circuits because thesedopaminergic circuits are tied toeverything you know there are examplesof people getting addicted to the mostincredible things they&amp;#39;re also examplesof people getting very good but notaddicted to chess for instance it&amp;#39;s allthe samegeneral set of mechanismsyeah you talked earlier aboutthe the knowledge of knowledge and thatwas the big breakthrough for me at thedarkest period of my life i happened tograb a book we talked about this brieflyin our first interview i happened tograb a book that talked aboutneuroplasticity and they werehypothesizing maybe this is a thingandthatgave me hope because i could imaginewhat was going on in my brain and once ican visualize it then i feel like i caninsert myself into it it&amp;#39;s why i&amp;#39;vegotten so interested in health why i&amp;#39;mso interested in neuroscienceis for me if i were sliding towardsdepression i would do exactly whatyou&amp;#39;re saying i would assess that and belike okay wait a second i know that ican insert conscious control i know thatthis is abiological experience and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;mobsessed with that idea that you&amp;#39;rehaving a biological experience and to melike there&amp;#39;s some people that see theway the magic trick is done and it losesthe magic then for other people it&amp;#39;slike you see that it&amp;#39;s this is somebodythat&amp;#39;s spent 30 000 hours learning howto move their hands so that you don&amp;#39;tnotice that they just move the coin youknow from this hand to this hand it&amp;#39;sit blows me away i love magic uh beforethe pandemic a friend took me up to themagic castle here in hollywood andthere&amp;#39;s some incredible stuff going onmagic is actually really cool we coulduh just as a from a neuroscienceperspective magic it&amp;#39;s all aboutcreating gaps in your perception that&amp;#39;sobvious rightand when that happens because the thebrain is so accustomed to the laws ofphysics like objects fall down not upetc when that happens it clearlytriggers the surprise circuitry and thatitself that feeling of delight andsurprise is absolutely tied also tothese dopamine dopamine circuits it&amp;#39;sinteresting though that that doesn&amp;#39;tsend us into like terror like the peopledepends on the magic trick when i wentthere there was this crazy trick thatthe guy did he took out cards and i wasinvited up to sit next to him i signedmy name on a cardi took the card i took the cardi tore it up i put it in my pocketand at the end of the show we wentthrough a series of things at the end ofthe show hetook off his shoe and presented the cardto me with the signature intact and thecard intact and that was my signatureso he clearly created gaps of perceptionum but at some point as adults so ithink as long as we know the context isright then we can we can do this onething about dopamine that i just want tomake sure iuh mention and it based on something yousaid earlier is thatone interesting question about the brainis just asking the question you know howdo we segment time how do we how do youknow that this podcast has obviously hasa beginning in the middle and an end butyou know how do we segment time and sothere have been some beautifulexperiments done recently showing thatuh for instance if you&amp;#39;re watching asports game regardless of whether or notyour team scores like let&amp;#39;s saybasketball goes down court let&amp;#39;s saythey missed the three-pointer and thenyou know it&amp;#39;s a close game there&amp;#39;s alittle blip of dopamine that says thatwas one segment of timeand so dopamine is a big way in which wesegment time the other way are blinksbelieve it or notyeah that every time we blink there&amp;#39;s apaper publishing current biology everytime we blink we reset our perception ofthat when i understand more i guess thanthe dopamine why would dopamine beinvolved in time perfect question turnsout that the frequency of blinking isset by the level baseline level ofdopamine in the brain yes so when peopleare wide-eyed with excitement andthey&amp;#39;re and they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re notblinking very often or someone is on adrug that kicks out a lot of dopaminethey hardly ever blink their pupils arehugethey&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re actually not segmentingtime in the normal fashionand so much of your life in retrospectis segmented by those peaks and dopaminethey those mark key events in your lifewhen you met your wife uh that theirtheirall the segments of your life are arenoted by peaks and dopamine or the waythat you happen to conceptualizedopamine and so also people who aredepressed are often very focused on thepast they ruin naturally they default toruminating on the past when you adjustpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine levels to healthylevels they start becoming more forwardthinking and more present and so there&amp;#39;sthis relationship between blinking andtime perception dopamine and blinkinghow you conceptualize time has a lot todo with these peaks and dopamine andwhen they occurand this is a big deal because we&amp;#39;re youknow 2020 was a rough year for mostpeople 2021&amp;#39;s feeling a little betterbut we don&amp;#39;t really know where we are inthis whole arc of everything that&amp;#39;shappeningthere&amp;#39;s a lot of uncertainty yeahthe dopamine peaks and the frequency ofthose dopamine peaks have everything todo with how we carve up our experienceof time and anyone who spent a lot oftime in deep meditationstarts to develop a kind of intuitiveinternal representation of the fact thattime is very fluid in this way when wesay time is fluid what we mean is thesecretion of dopamine and these pulsesis very fluid they are under control ofour of what&amp;#39;s happening externally butalso how you conceptualize your lifelike where are you in your life are youyou know hopefully we&amp;#39;ll if davidsinclair has his way and hopefully hewill we will all live to be you knowmore than a hundred years oldhopefully in good vitality so this isthe more esoteric aspect of dopaminereal fast before we go about the timething yeah let me ask you so there was aperiod in my life i&amp;#39;ll take it at abouttwo years where for whatever reason i itcould have been six hours since i lastlooked at a clock i would be withinthree minutes of what time it was and mywife found it hilarious and so she&amp;#39;d belike what time is it and i&amp;#39;m like ohit&amp;#39;s 4 58.it was so weird that it like made myradar is like oh my god i have like thisspecial power and then it went awayand now i can probably get you within 15minutes but like uh it was really eerieis is there does that make a predictionor a round likea consistency of dopamine release orsomething yeah you nailed it it&amp;#39;s theconsistency that&amp;#39;s an internal it&amp;#39;s aninterval timer as we say so whenpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine is low they tend tooverestimate okay okayand when people&amp;#39;s dopamine is high theytend to underestimate time now it istrue that dopamine when it&amp;#39;s released isa little bit of a stimulant in thesystem because of the way it works withepinephrine how finely you slice time isvery dependent on dopamine and yourinternal level of autonomic arousal areally good example would be you&amp;#39;rereally excited about something or you&amp;#39;rereally stressed about something doesn&amp;#39;tmatter dopamine iselevated in excitement butnorepinephrine epinephrine tend to beelevated any time we&amp;#39;re agitated or orexcitedjust imagine you need to catch a flightyou&amp;#39;re in line at the security and theperson in front of you seems likethey&amp;#39;re going really really slowly yourframe rate is faster you&amp;#39;re just carvingup time more finely people are in caraccidents and then they reporteverything being in slow motion yourframe rate is issmaller you&amp;#39;re essentially gettingyou&amp;#39;re taking larger time bins and thisis why let&amp;#39;s say you wake up and you&amp;#39;rereally tired or you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re kindof out of it and you look and it&amp;#39;s liketext messages and emails and all thisstuff the world seems like it&amp;#39;s going byreally really fastdopamine is what is the diagno is thedynamic process by dopamine release ishould say is the dynamic process bywhich you adjust time perception so ifyou had a very keen perception of thepassage of time right down to the minuteor so that suggests very regularintervals of dopamine release and that&amp;#39;sprobably tied to outside events that arebelow your conscious awarenessbutuh dopamine releases i i sort ofnot to make this uh pg-13 or r-rated butif we go back to the example of sex sexand sleep are the two times when spaceand time have a very fluid typerelationship it&amp;#39;s veryhard to conceive space and time in sleepthat&amp;#39;s actually the nature of sleep iswe do the long blink no joke we closethe shutters stop bringing in externalinformation and in sleep space and timeare veryfluid right things can happen very fastor very slow slow motion you can beflying it there&amp;#39;s a lot of you know someof it is dreaming but space and time arevery fluid in wakefulnessspace and time are very anchored byphysical events in the world but ourperception of those is dynamicallyregulated by how much dopamine is in oursystem so it&amp;#39;s beginning to sound likedopamine does everything but it&amp;#39;s reallyassociated with motivation craving andtime interval keeping and so i would bewilling to bet that your pulses ofdopamine were very regular just likedropsso interesting so we do a lot of thingswho knows what i was doing at thatperiod if it had to do anything justthat i&amp;#39;m getting older and so it startsto disrupt itself who knows butwhat are some things so one thing i&amp;#39;veheard you talk about which i find reallyinterestingwhen i think about all the things thatwe&amp;#39;re doing that are disrupting thingsall these unintended consequences ofmodern behaviori am truly glad thatcell phones the internet and pornographydid not exist when i was younger becausei don&amp;#39;t know if at 14i could have been disciplined enough ifi had access to that andwhat like when you think about thethings that we&amp;#39;re doing right now thatare sort of the that have maybe the mostgrand unintended consequences where doyou landyeah on the time scale of 24 hours oneof the the huge mistakes that we allmake and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;ve said this many timesso if people have heard me say thisbefore forgive me but it turns out it&amp;#39;sstill trueuhgetting too much bright light exposurefrom the hours of 10 pm until 4 amunless you have to work shift work whichis a unique casethat bright light exposure between 10 pmand 4 am even if youadjust the colors of the lights youstill need to get everything reallyreally dim because it actuallyblocks the release of dopamine through apathway that involves a structure calledthe habenulathe habenula was a kind of crypticstructure in the brain for a long timebut now we know there&amp;#39;s a punishmentsignal in the brain you getneurochemically punishedfor viewing bright light at those hourshow how would that be wired in we&amp;#39;dnever be able to expose ourselves tobright light ah so that&amp;#39;s a greatquestion so firelight won&amp;#39;t do thatmoonlight&amp;#39;s fine candles lights that aredim are now in your environmentso the the pathway to the habenula andthen to these dopamine reducing circuitsare the pain pathway that we&amp;#39;rereferring to earlier it&amp;#39;s a genericpathway through which lots of differenttypes of signals and stimuli and eventscan punish us internally this is so gooddude and so i&amp;#39;m going to call this therich kid effectlike there and you mentioned hard workearlier there is a reason i think thatchildren of wealthy parents end upimploding because there is a anevolutionary the punishment pathwayevolutionary thing that&amp;#39;s going on thatsays you didn&amp;#39;t have to work hard forthe things that you own and because fromuh i need you to go hunt and gather andface a saber-toothed tiger i have toreward you for doing hard things andpunish you for not doing hard thingswell andyou know in the case of the thethe generic model of the of the spoiledrich kid it they actually can&amp;#39;t accessdopamine uh remember that that a moviefrom the 80s it was a uh it was calledlike the toy or something with richard iwas like if this [ __ ] says toyi&amp;#39;m gonna have a seizure yesrichard pryor in that movie and the kidhas everything and he&amp;#39;s the he&amp;#39;s theepitome of the spoiled brat all the toysall the cars all the things now we seethis with people who actually go fromrags to riches and then bathe in alltheir the luxuries they didn&amp;#39;t have as achild these are often the athletes thatdon&amp;#39;t go on to perform well againthese are people that crash because ofother dopamine-seeking behaviors youknow i&amp;#39;m not going to call out names butthere are far too many examples of theseand i don&amp;#39;t call out names mostlybecause we are all capable of this weall would like to think that oh if i hadall that money or if i had all thatsuccess i would really be a good humanbeing and i wouldn&amp;#39;t do those thingsanyone any human being that is immersedin these dopamine circuits too much orwho gets too much pleasure withouthaving to pursue it first and reallywork andactually experience pain pleasureratcheting back and forth along thatclimb because it wasn&amp;#39;t just dopaminelike this for you it&amp;#39;s probably painpleasure pain pleasure painpleasure pain right they&amp;#39;re alwaysproportional to one anotherso anyone that does that it has atremendously hard time accessingpleasurethey can&amp;#39;t do that and and we oftenthink about the extremes of addictionand those are really severe but we alsohave to think about the more subtleforms of something we really love butindulging in it just a little too oftenso that it no longer has that edgeyou know there have been really goodstudies of people who jump out ofairplanes with parachutes you knowi&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun it looks likea thrill but people do over and over andover againoften diedoing other things they often becomedrug addicts because it&amp;#39;s a huge high ohyeah yeah a lot of thatand you know there are a lot of examplesof this i mean you can get addicted toanything the key is to regulate thatbehavior so you asked whatyou know what should people do wellcertainlyi&amp;#39;m trying this now and i have some goodexamples some young people i know andwork with are taking breaks from notjust social media but no cell phonewhatsoever i&amp;#39;m actually trying an oddexperiment which isfor the first hour of every day no phonemostly because part of your 25 no-gosyesright so we have circuitry in the brainrelated to the so-called basal gangliaand we have go sort of activating youknow think gas pedal and then we there&amp;#39;sa lot of no go circuitryandlearning how to keep that no go don&amp;#39;tcircuitry as we could call ituh tuned up is very important and somany times throughout the day but i tryand get 25 a day where i activelyrefrain from doing something that iimpulsively want to do could be lookingat my phone but it could even besomething trivial like i want to walk tothe kitchen and get a glass of water soi&amp;#39;m actively engaging inself-denin denial not cognitive denial probablythat too but how would i know um but inaction-based denial so restricting mybehavior in some way as a way of keepingthese dopamine circuits tuned up alsonot looking at my phone first thing inthe morning for an hour becauseknowing what we now know about thesecond phase of sleep and rem sleepbeing more predominant the second waveof sleep and the fact that you&amp;#39;reworking through a lot of emotional andlogistical contingencies you&amp;#39;rereshaping your brain in sleep that&amp;#39;swhen neuroplasticity occurs during sleepit&amp;#39;s triggered in wakefulness but itactually takes place in sleep especiallythat second half of sleepwhen you wake up in the morning you arein a perfect position to what i callreceive the download of all the workthat your neural circuitry has beendoing the night before but if youimmediately go to a sensory experienceespecially a rich sensory experience ofstuff scrolling by you&amp;#39;re actuallymissing the information that youprocessed at night and even moreimportantly that second half of thenight during rem sleep is when theemotional weight of things start becomeslet&amp;#39;s sayyou put it on the shelf properly thingsthat are important to emotionalemotionally registered get put in oneshelf things that were like the commentyou got on twitter that was triggeringdoesn&amp;#39;t seem like such a big deal aftera good night&amp;#39;s sleep and that&amp;#39;s becausethat second half of sleep is actuallywhen you re-experience these things butyour body can&amp;#39;t secrete adrenaline it&amp;#39;skind of an internal form of therapy oreven trauma therapy and that&amp;#39;s whypeople who don&amp;#39;t get that sleep are veryyou know they&amp;#39;re easily agitated theyfeel like the world is crushing down onthem so when i wake up in the morning iwant to receive ideas that i want tolearn from my learning and if you takein new information you are not in aposition to do that and 60 minutes is atough one so i give myself two no-gosfor the 60-minute block if i can do itand i&amp;#39;ll tell you a lot of mornings ifail tom i don&amp;#39;t do it interesting ijust i found that shocking but i heardyou say that in another interview and iwas like well i mean i&amp;#39;m human you knowthere are mornings whereum i get enticed or worseworse i find myself reflexively pickingup without having made the consciousdecision and that&amp;#39;s wheni realized thatyou know we are alldeep in this process and i thinkuh we have to regulate it the theexperiment i&amp;#39;d like to do maybe you&amp;#39;lldo this with me as a challenge becausethe challenge is always good is in thenew year i actually want to take everyodd waking hour of the day off the phoneso even hours of the dayas long as it&amp;#39;s waking i&amp;#39;m willing tohave it on and work with it but oddhours just turn it off no matter whati don&amp;#39;t know if this will destroy mostof the relationshipsbut just to see can i do it on a rigidlyexternally imposed schedule because ifyou think about most of the growth inlife comes from these rigidly externallyimposed schedules and we hate thembut they are where we learn restraintdude this is so important i don&amp;#39;t knowif i hate them anymore so people willoften ask like how i do this that or theother whatever it is like tom how do youumso i work 93 hours a week that&amp;#39;s like myaverage that&amp;#39;s your average sotom why do you work 93 hours every weekand the answer is because 93 are joyfuland 94 wouldn&amp;#39;tandwhen i start working more than that itusually means that i&amp;#39;m juggling so manythings that my brain seems to be usingsleep as a way to track some of them orsomething yeah so i find myself wakingup a lot no i have a trick that allowsme to fall back asleep very fast butit&amp;#39;s still not as restful as justsleeping through the night what&amp;#39;s thetrick if you don&amp;#39;t mind me entering idon&amp;#39;t at all so i have two pairs ofairpod headphonesand i put them inand i put them on a uhfiction book and i turn the volume downsuch that if i don&amp;#39;t put a little bit ofpressure on my ear i can&amp;#39;t make out whatthey&amp;#39;re saying so as soon as i drift offthe pressure releases and i can stillhear that noise is being made but ican&amp;#39;t track it and so i&amp;#39;m usually outprobably in about three minutes wow thatthat changed my life in terms of when iget stressed i can still fall backasleep such a great skill and justreflecting on what you usethat murmur in the background and thiskind of low level i can&amp;#39;t quite detectit is actually the way that your braindetects things as you&amp;#39;re falling asleepso i wonder if you&amp;#39;ve triggered yourcircuit to run in reverse where youactually can send yourself back underwhat what it makes me think is that ican&amp;#39;tprocess the problemsand listen to a story at the same timeand so my brain clicks over into storymode and it&amp;#39;s like oh we&amp;#39;re digestingthis story i i&amp;#39;m getting input sobecause i&amp;#39;m getting input because it&amp;#39;sstory my brain lets go of i have tosolve problems and then that allows meto fall right back asleep that&amp;#39;s greatsuch a great skill and waking up in themiddle of the night from time to time touse the bathroom is actually quitenormaland some people are really obsessed bythe fact oh no i woke up and then theyget triggered but i learned this lastyear umthat thepeak in our alertness is actually about90 minutes before our natural bedtimeand a lot of people they you know theyreach the point in the evening wherethey&amp;#39;reready to go to sleep and then they feelall this you know excitement and surgeof energy and they think oh no i&amp;#39;m notgoing to be able to fall asleep butthat&amp;#39;s actually a natural surge that&amp;#39;sfollowed by a dip a lot of people alsohave the trouble of waking up in themiddle of the night and wondering whythey can&amp;#39;t fall back asleep this isdreadfully hard for a lot of people istruggled that for years yeah and one ofthe solutions is to go to bed earlierbecause it means that your melatonin isstarting to get released early in theevening and so we all have the naturalability to push to stay late stay uplater if we really need to this hasobvious adaptive utility but some peopleby who should go to bed quote unquoteshould go to bed at 9 or 10 p.m they&amp;#39;repushing to 11 or 12 and then theirmelatonin signal is starting to drop offnow they can&amp;#39;t fall asleepor they&amp;#39;re waking up at two or three inthe morning and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re introuble but it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve hitthe right schedule 93 hours is animpressive outputthat&amp;#39;s a lot of years of making anobscene amount of mistakes and to closethe loop on so people how do youaccomplish xyz and the answer is partlyrulesso you have to be obsessed with yourgoal right so for me that&amp;#39;s allobsessions start with a goal what do youwant is that thing exciting andhonorable assuming it&amp;#39;s exciting andhonorable there&amp;#39;s ways to like createfeedback loops which is largely whatwe&amp;#39;ve been talking about today aboutattaching the dopaminergic responsespecifically to the pursuit of thatthing rather than having itandbyto because i&amp;#39;m so excited and because iso believe in the reality of my goalsthat i actually could have them and thathaving them would be awesomei can create rules in my life and then ireally stick to those rules so once i&amp;#39;mvery careful about what rules i put inplace because i have to believe thatthey will actually lead me to this goalthat&amp;#39;s really exciting for me but if ibelieve it then i can put them in andthen also part of my identity is thati&amp;#39;m the type of person that when i set arule i follow it so i can create thisloop of like feeling good about myselfand the thing that i&amp;#39;m pursuing but itreally works and i&amp;#39;m shocked how fewpeople have the kind of rule that you&amp;#39;retalking about in the new year to say heyi&amp;#39;m only going to do odd hours there&amp;#39;sno phone yeah well and like i said i&amp;#39;mnot perfect i&amp;#39;m not as disciplined asyou are about my no goes i try iactually find that tabulating is is kindof funum it&amp;#39;s also fun to get reallytriggering commentsand and to not close the dopamine loopfor them i think if people understood umthe dopamine reward prediction errorthat we could end all the umamplifying comment battles onlinebecause what happens is if someone takesa a jab at you of any kind there&amp;#39;sactually an open dopamine loop waitingfor you to respond and any responseactually gives them that that dopamineresponse of success it&amp;#39;s a little bit ofa it&amp;#39;s like scoring a three-pointer andthe no response actually drops theirdopamine below baseline and that&amp;#39;s itsown form of retaliation and i have to becareful because i don&amp;#39;t want toencourage people to retaliate but anyanything that short-circuits the kind ofmadness of getting pulled intosome online battle that&amp;#39;s totallymeaningless it&amp;#39;s taking people away fromother powerful good things that theycould do in the worldyou know we&amp;#39;ve been talking mainly aboutdopamine and its scheduling and aboutthe fact that it can be attached toanything i thinkmany people find it hard to subjectivelyattach dopamine to something they don&amp;#39;twant to do this is something that uh ifwe&amp;#39;d spoken a year ago i would&amp;#39;ve i myanswer would have been a little bitdifferent to the question of how do youget motivated well one way to do that isif you are good at subjectivelyattachingdopamine to the pursuit just knowingokay i really am hungry for this i&amp;#39;mjust i&amp;#39;m going to tell myself that youknow making you know making it onepercent of the wayis a success and i&amp;#39;m going to keep goingand i&amp;#39;m going to keep ratcheting on andthat&amp;#39;s great if you can do that but forpeople that can&amp;#39;t do that understandingthis relationship with a pleasure painbalance can be more powerful justunderstanding the more friction and painthat you experience the greater thedopamine reward you will get later andthat serves as its own amplifier of thewhole process of pursuing more dopamineand then the other aspect of itis that any time that we&amp;#39;re leaning intoactionyou know it has thepossibility of being an amplifyingprocess or a depleting processand the key to that is making sure thatyou&amp;#39;re balancing the dopamine andepinephrine systems you know epinephrinebeing this molecule of universalcurrency of energy output it could beout of hate or it could be out of loveepinephrine doesn&amp;#39;t care and actuallydopamine doesn&amp;#39;t care none of thesesystems care about us they justwork underneath our underneath ourconscious control but when you start tounderstand thathitting the gas pedal is great buthitting the gas pedal and then comingoff the gas pedal a little bityou can kind of sit in a more relaxedrpm actually allows you to go muchfurther i think that peopleleaning into action is terrific i alwayssay you can either be back on your heelsflat footed or forward center of massthe best situation is actually to beright upright but just know that you canbe forward center of mass at any pointand you know that to take it back to sexand reproduction because it&amp;#39;s a salientexample the arc of of sex is veryinteresting because when you think aboutautonomic arousal it turns out that thethe arousal stage of sex actuallyinvolves release of dopaminebut is what we call parasympatheticdominant it&amp;#39;s actually has to be relaxedenoughin order to occur okay everyone can readbetween the lines on thisorgasm is actuallyai want to say full blown it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s ait is a sympatheticnervous system driven response it&amp;#39;sidentical to the stress system it&amp;#39;sdriven by the same neural circuits asstressand then what comes afterwardthe parasympathetic system goes back upagain it&amp;#39;s that deep relaxation so whydo i say this not to talk about sex tobeyou know to to serve as a highlighterbut rather our species arrived herebecause of this dance between arousaland relaxation arousal and relaxationand one thing we can say for sure aboutevery human being that&amp;#39;s alive now isthat their parents at least oncemastered this dance of relaxed but notand excited but not too excited thenreally excited and then relaxed thatdance was mastered by all of our parentsand that&amp;#39;s what delivered us here tosome extent and so iwhat this means is that all the neuralcircuits from the ones that led to ourconception to the ones that lead to uspursuing goals have thisbalance that&amp;#39;s almost like a like aseesaw right there&amp;#39;s activation and calmactivation and calm and it&amp;#39;s thatdynamic process that&amp;#39;s important tomaster in every endeavor so we use sexas an example but in pursuit of goalsyou have to learn how to pursueshort-term goalsand like the goals within the day make acup of coffee and goal and long-termgoals and when i said dopamine is what&amp;#39;ssetting theyour time perception it&amp;#39;s an intervaltimerwhat you&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s like the twomarshmallow experiment done at stanforddef defer the dopamineand actually if you can turn the waitinginto the dopamine and thenyou can extend out the reward for youknow waiting for the second marshmallow15 minutes later et cetera et cetera andthere are many many examples of this inthe psychology and neuroscienceliterature and i would say finally in2020 we finally as a field got a clearidea of how dopamine is really workingbecause before it was all aboutwork dopamine hit rightsex gives you a doubling hit theinternet gives you a dopamine what wedidn&amp;#39;t realize is that repeatedengagement with these things leads todopamine depletionand that the pain and pleasure balanceis always at workdude that&amp;#39;s so brilliant dudeone the huberman lab is amazing onyoutube people need to check that [ __ ]out and your instagram page is alsoamazingwhere do you want people to follow youat

that theanimal withoutdopamine still enjoys foodstill enjoys other pleasures so dopamineis not really involved in the enjoymentof those pleasures it&amp;#39;s involved inmotivation because if you make theanimal have to move just one rat&amp;#39;slengthbelieve it or not to get to that leverthe animal with dopamine will work to goget that thing it will work through someeffort to go get the reward whereas theanimal or turns out the human withoutmuch dopaminecan still experience pleasure they cansit on their couch and cram their facewith pleasure inducing calories or whathave you watch pleasure-inducing thingson the television but they have verylittle motivation to go pursue thingsthat will deliver them pleasureso when i say dopamine is the universalcurrencyofeverything what i mean is it&amp;#39;s drivingthe motivation to develop new currencieswhen somebody can sit back and say uhi&amp;#39;ll just throw this number out let&amp;#39;ssay somebody has a hundred thousandbitcoins which presumably now is worthoh my godcertainly more than it was a few yearsagothe way they can register whether or notthey are in a position of wealth or nothas everything to do with the the numberthey see on the screen or in theirbitcoin walletbutthat number is converted into a chemicalsignal that has everything to do withhow much you had previously so so wecould talk about the so-called rewardprediction error how good you feel withan experience has everything to do withhow muchyou had previouslyand dopamine itself is what&amp;#39;s drivingthe human species tocreate these new technologies and sowhile we think of currencies as the goalit&amp;#39;s actually what&amp;#39;s really driven theforward evolution of our our species hasbeen the desire to go seek things beyondthe confines of our skin and when i saythe common currency is dopamine what imean is the molecule dopamine whensecreted in the brain makes us pursuethings build things create things makesus want new things that we don&amp;#39;tcurrently already have and so it has alot of dimensions to it but rather thanthink about dopamine as a signal forreward like a dopamine hit weclassically think to talk about it it&amp;#39;smore accurate really to think aboutdopamine as driving motivation andcraving to go seek rewards that&amp;#39;s therad experiment and it&amp;#39;s a way oftabulating where we are in our life arewe doing well or are we doing poorly andthat happens on very short time scaleslike do you wake up feeling good or doyou wake up feeling kind of loworon long time scales if you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough a long degree or you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough your life how are you doing howdo you gauge that well it has everythingto do with how much dopamine you werereleasing in the previous days and weeksand years so you&amp;#39;re always comparing andall of this is subconscious but what&amp;#39;scool is that once you make theseprocesses conscious once you understanda little bit about how dopamine isreleased and how it changes ourperspective and our behavior then youcan actually work with it so it&amp;#39;s one oftheum instances where knowledge ofknowledge actually turns out to be areally useful tooldude that&amp;#39;s crazy to me so one of thethings that i get hit up about all thetime ispeople feel stuckand as you like really push on them tofigure out why they feel stuck they&amp;#39;llbe like yeah i want to do that and but ijust you know i can&amp;#39;t get out of bed ori don&amp;#39;t have the energy to pursue it orwhatever andyou get into thiscommon thing that people say in mindsetand i really believe it but i find itfar more interesting when you&amp;#39;re talkingabout it from a neuro chemicalstandpoint which is you just don&amp;#39;t wantit badly enoughand when i think aboutmy own life i sometimes worrythat i&amp;#39;m either more malleable thanother people or that i have a greaterability to manipulate my dopaminerelease or whateverbecause i&amp;#39;m very good at building desireand i like the way that desire feels nowwhen you use the word hunger i thinkpeople get confused because i actuallydon&amp;#39;t enjoy being hungry for food i findthat totally unpleasurablehowever being hungry for sex i findincredibly i feel alive i feel focused ifeel energized i feel aggressive it&amp;#39;scomplex for sure but i find that feelingincred the the act of wanting somethingin the future in in that kind or inbusiness and trying to build somethingi&amp;#39;ve in fact that&amp;#39;s an interestinginsight into my own selfabouti like to buildanddo we know so we dopamine is theneurochemistry of the pursuit of makingsure that i have the energy to go but dowe know how we can spike thatwell first of all it&amp;#39;s clear to me basedon your description that you&amp;#39;ve tappedinto theseuh channels that release dopaminebecause craving and wanting whether ornot it&amp;#39;s sex or or uh money orconnectionor anything all right uh is that&amp;#39;s thethe primary trigger for dopamine releaseyeah now sex and reproduction makes themost sense from the perspective ofevolution uh i mean any species everyspecieshas tends to have two primary goals oneprotect it&amp;#39;s young and second make moreof itself usually in reverse order rightso even for people that don&amp;#39;t wantchildren i mean you might not or peopleof course not everyone is having sexjust to reproduce but at a primordiallevel that&amp;#39;s what those circuits arethere for so every species in particularmammalian species where there&amp;#39;s a lot ofparenting and caretakingof the youngtries to take make more of itself andeverything that you see like maternalaggression which is a powerful circuitthat gets activated afterfemales of any species in particularmammals give birth they will fight tothe death and they gain superhumanstrength in order to protect their youngthat&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a known circuit forthat in the brain that gets activatedonce a female has offspringand it&amp;#39;s robustinside tracker is offering our listeners25 off their entire store includinginner age 2.0 just visitinsidetracker.comimpact theory all right guys check outinside tracker today take care and belegendaryso interesting man like have you readthe book the female brain i have not ohmy god so i just probably lost a lot ofpoints but no no but you&amp;#39;re one it&amp;#39;ll besuper interesting because you&amp;#39;ll know ifshe&amp;#39;s on the right track from aneuroscience perspective i rememberreading the book at the time i thought iwas going to have kidsand i remember thinking whoa like thisbook chronicles what happens to awoman&amp;#39;s brain and how things change andi was like when you have kids man youare inviting aneurochemical change in your significantother that is going to play itself outin a very real way and i&amp;#39;d be lying if isaid that wasn&amp;#39;t one of the things oneof the many things but one of the thingsthat i factored into not having kidsinteresting uh and then the same withmenopause that it&amp;#39;s this really dramaticsort of reorganizing might not be theright word but that it it has realimplications in theway that the person moves just as thedecline of testosterone has in men wellin on aon the positive sideduring pregnancy the woman&amp;#39;s hippocampusher brain area associated with memoryand retention of information it goesthrough a period in which it gets worsefor certain types of information butthen achieves superior levels of workingmemory oncethe babies arrive because there are alot of things to manage so this makessense this is true in rodents this istrue in humans and then in terms of thebiology of the father we now know thatwhen because typically parents have uhyou know does seem like one spousealways does more than the otherbut even in the most evenly dividedhouseholdsthe there&amp;#39;s usually some co-parenting ofsome sort but that the father has abig increase in the hormone prolactinwhenthe mother is expecting and theprolactin lays down body fat it preparesfor sleepless nights for women it itsparks um the circuitry for milk letdownfor for nursingso the dad bod has a lot to do withprolactin this is true in in birds insmall mammals and in humans and this isnow there was a paper published innatureon humans specifically about this andwhen you think about the relationshipbetween dopamine and prolactin it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;sinteresting and it takes us back to thismotivation and craving that you weredescribing earlier which is thatdopamine and prolactin work in inopposite fashionso the the most salient example of thisis sex and reproduction whereanticipation of sex and reproductiongreatly increases dopaminebut postsreproductivepost-sex it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be forreproduction there&amp;#39;s a spark inprolactin in the mail that&amp;#39;s the spikeexcuse me in prolactin and that spike inprolactin is actually what sets therefractory period during which he can&amp;#39;tmate again so it sets a period ofquiescence to keepmen it&amp;#39;s repair bonding for the exchangeof chemicals through the nose to thethrough the skin and through the sweatmainly through odor uh we could talkabout pheromones if you want but that&amp;#39;sa topic that&amp;#39;s somewhat controversialthe actual identity of pheromones inhumans has not been identified but thereare pheromone effects in humanscontroversial in that people don&amp;#39;t agreewhat&amp;#39;s really happening well okay sothere&amp;#39;s this culture of biologists thathave clearly identifiedpheromone effects in other in non-humansand non-human primatesbut whether or not those arethe classic definition of a pheromoneeffect is that it&amp;#39;s subconscious thatyou can&amp;#39;t actually detect the smellhowever we know that smells themselvesconscious detection of them can evokevery robust physiological responses oneone example to just stay in this arenaof of of thought is that a guy by thename of gnome sobel who&amp;#39;s at theweizmann institute he used to be atberkeley he has a lab over in israel hisamazing lab works on olfactionsmell and they discovered that the scentof women&amp;#39;s tears causes a dramatic andsignificant reduction in testosterone inmen what absolutely and this waspublished if anyone wants to go look itup it was published in science magazineyou know you can smell tears yeah wehave you know the super bowl ofpublishing and science is science natureand self those are the three topjournals this is published in sciencemagazine very stringent uh the smell oftears now it&amp;#39;s subconscious at somelevelbut the other thing that if we weregoing to kind of play around in thishormones and behave interactions betweenhumans um there are some reallyinteresting examples so for instancemenwill rate the smell of a woman&amp;#39;s skin orsweat or the perception of her face asmore beautiful during the pre-ovulatoryphase of her menstrual cyclethat pre-ovulatory phase is associatedwith a number of different changes inhormones okayjust that smell will increasetestosterone in a maleoral contraception in the femalewomen taking oral contraception itadjusts their hormones such that men nolonger detect this change inhow attractive women are doesn&amp;#39;t meanthey find them unattractive but it meansthey don&amp;#39;t find them increasinglyinteractive during this certain periodof the of their of their menstrual cycleso we are constantly signaling back andforth through hormones in fact we metover thereand shook hands because we&amp;#39;ve beentested for covet and the rest we shookhands andwhat happened and what happens within 30seconds of any human being contactingone another is they shake hands and thenthey wipe their the chemicals of theother person on their facegnome&amp;#39;s lab has also shown this and sowe are constantly signaling throughthrough chemical exchange sometimes it&amp;#39;ssubconscious and those are the so-calledpheromone effects sometimes it&amp;#39;s lowlevels of odors that are beneath ourconscious detection and sometimes it&amp;#39;soutright wow this person smells reallyreally good or they look particularlygood today oftentimes that&amp;#39;s tied to theof the period in which they areovulating in their menstrual cycle so iwant to plant a flag here about all thethings that we dothat aremessing with these mechanisms likecologne or deodorant or oralcontraception of which i&amp;#39;m not saying ispornography like all interception hasserved a great role in it for certainpeople some people might say was this anethical discussion or is it good is itbad but um either way it is having aneffect right so to remove i only look atthings through the lens of biology notthrough the lens of of whether or not weshould or shouldn&amp;#39;t do things i love itokay so we&amp;#39;re planning that we&amp;#39;re comingback to it but now i want to get to howdo we spike intentionally you&amp;#39;ve talkedabout we can spike testosterone but iwant to know can we spike dopamineyeah so um and you&amp;#39;ve done this so yourexample ofcraving isactually what you crave you crave thefeeling of craving is beautiful becauseit would what it means is that you don&amp;#39;tallow yourself to go so far down the arcof the dopamine trajectory to get to theother source of motivation so there aretwo sources of motivation as it relatesto dopamine and then we can think abouttools that we could export from thesethat are nested in neurobiologythe first is to do what you dowhich is to be able to sense the cravingas its own form of pleasure this haskind of remnants of carol dweck&amp;#39;s growthmindset that you eventually develop apleasure in the seeking and the strivinghas you know uh has flavors of a davidgoggins type approach where where itseems like he gets pleasure from thefriction itself and so there areelements of that you seem to have thatas wellbutif you can start to identify the cravingas its own internally released drug thisthing dopamine that is a source ofmotivation then what you realize is thatcapturing the reward is wonderfulbut attaching dopamine to the reward isactually a little bit dangerousattaching yeah this is celebrating thewin celebrating the win more than thepursuit it actually sets you up forfailure in the future and so this getsus right into something called dopaminereward prediction error and rewardprediction error is basically if youexpect something to be really greatand then it&amp;#39;s not quite that great yourdopamine baseline lowers and nowunderstanding what we know aboutdopamine that means that not only didyou you feel as if you lost because itwasn&amp;#39;t as much a celebration as youthought it would be but it also meansthat you&amp;#39;re starting from a lower placemeaning you are less motivated now thesimpler way to conceptualize this ishave a colleague at stanford she runsthe addiction dual diagnosis clinic atuh her name is dr anna lemke she has abook called dopamine nation that&amp;#39;s outright nowand she&amp;#39;s really described as pleasurepain balance where anytime you have abunch of dopamine and you&amp;#39;re in pursuitpursuit pursuitafter you achieve a win now this couldbe a business win a relationship a winof any kindbutinevitably there&amp;#39;s going to be a tippingback of the scale on the pain side andthat pain side is always going to go alittle bit higher than the dopamine sideso this is what you would feel if youpursued a goal like building a bigcompanyhere it comes here comes the big saleand then there&amp;#39;s the well what now thekind of letdown now if you wait if yousimply wait and stop pursuing dopaminefor a short while the scale starts toresetthe problem is a lot of peopleimmediately roll right into the nextpursuitand then what happens is that scalestarts to get stuck on the pain side alittle bit more a little bit more alittle bit more and pretty soon noamount of seeking will allow you toexperience that craving and motivationso what what does this mean in terms ofan actual tool well first of allif people can do what you do they&amp;#39;regoing to be in a much better position inlife it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s schoolsport relationship any domain of life ifyou can start to register ah thatcraving and that friction and thatdesire that almost kind of low level ofagitation sometimes high level ofagitation that is that i&amp;#39;m trying toimpose my will on the world in abenevolent way we hopethat&amp;#39;s dopamine it&amp;#39;s working with itsclose cousin which is epinephrine whichis adrenaline they are very closecousins in fact dopamine manufacturesepinephrine a lot of people don&amp;#39;t knowthis but adrenaline is actually madefrom the molecule dopamineokay so those two are hanging outtogether it&amp;#39;s like crave work crave workcraving work craving work craving workand then you get the winand some peopleallow the big peak in dopamine to beassociated with the winandsmart peoplelearn to adjust their celebrationinternally right this is all internalyou could throw the biggest party in theworld but as long as you&amp;#39;re kind of inlaid backandlooking at this not letting yourself getmanic crazyyou won&amp;#39;t necessarily crash as hardand pretty soon your system will resetso you take the day you clean up thedishes you relax you go what now i&amp;#39;mfeeling a little low well rather thangoing out and spiking your dopamineagain just wait understand that thescale will reset again give yourself afew days where you&amp;#39;re going to feel alittle kind of underwhelmed thingsaren&amp;#39;t going to be as interestingit&amp;#39;s going to be hard to trigger thatbig release because you just hadthe peakwell if you adjust that you relax youunderstand there&amp;#39;s always a little bitof a postpartum depressionwe sometimes hear about postpartumdepression that&amp;#39;s a clinical thing butthere&amp;#39;s always that kind of today&amp;#39;s notas excitingas the previous days what am i going todo with my life but thenif you let it start ratcheting up againthen what you realize is your capacityto tap into dopamine as a motivator notjust seeking dopamine rewards that isinfinite and i i can say with with greatcertainty that this ishow you were able to build a big companyand sell it how you&amp;#39;ve been able tobuild a successful podcast and sell ithow you constantly seeking becauseseeking is the reward and i think formost people we think of the reward asthe finish line and so the key is to getto the finish line step into the endzone but no end zone dance it&amp;#39;s justlike yep and now i&amp;#39;m gonna go do itagainthat&amp;#39;s really the key that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s thekey to doing it over and over and when isee big athletes oracademics or anyone or musicians andtheyrise and crashit&amp;#39;s clear they&amp;#39;ve lost the touch withthe motivation evoked dopamine andthey&amp;#39;ve lost touch probably because ithasn&amp;#39;t really been described by theneuroscience community until anna hasstarted talking about this stuffpublicly and i&amp;#39;m just kind of echoingwhat she&amp;#39;s beautifully saidsaid much better than i am which is thatyou should always expect that after abunch of pleasure there&amp;#39;s going to bethat low and then that craving how do iget back to there again and the key isyou have to walk the staircase again youdon&amp;#39;t get to do this as a square wavepull you know you don&amp;#39;t get to justascend ascend ascend it&amp;#39;s always updownup a little bit higher down up you knowit&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the functionso um i don&amp;#39;t know if that resonateswith your experience i&amp;#39;m over herefreaking out so you&amp;#39;ve literally justexplained what i will say is the singlemost important loop if you want to besuccessfuland you used wordsattach right you had another one whichwas about your t i forget the exact wordbut you&amp;#39;re taking you&amp;#39;re insertingyourself consciously into the processbecause what i learned very early on andi&amp;#39;m so grateful in the same way that youare grateful that your upbringing wasn&amp;#39;tperfect but it ended up giving you aframe of reference and insights thathave propelled you forward i&amp;#39;m verygrateful that i spent a decade justtrying to get rich that was the statedmission i would say it every day likei&amp;#39;m here to get rich i show up to workto get rich it&amp;#39;s about getting rich richrich rich and it didn&amp;#39;t workand so and my wife pulls me aside andshe&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re now damaging themarriage like you&amp;#39;re just so fiendishlyfocused on the goalthat there&amp;#39;s nothing as integrated inyour life you&amp;#39;re doing something youhate for an end state that may nevercomeand that was so profound and it shook meso deeply and it suddenly became clearthat from a neurological perspectivewhat i wanted was to feel alive and oncei put everything in the pursuit i&amp;#39;m justinterested in can i show up every dayand sincerely pursue this thing which imay never get but i&amp;#39;m gonna honor myselfcelebrate myself big up myself as thebrits would say for just showing uptoday and actually trying to make ithappenand one that&amp;#39;s way more sustainable andthen two you don&amp;#39;tyou don&amp;#39;t get tricked into thinking thatoh when i get this thing that i&amp;#39;ll feelgood because it&amp;#39;s the craving that makesme feel alive so it&amp;#39;s the state ofwanting that is in and of itself thepleasurable act that&amp;#39;s right and soi began to use the metaphor of i&amp;#39;m gonnaclimb this mountain only to want thenext mountain to climb and once i knewthat well then you have to be totallycomfortable dropping back down andstarting all over now the interestingthing and i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m foolingmyself or if i haveso integrated that trickbut the come down isn&amp;#39;t hard for me soi i think my last day at quest was amondayand tuesday i started impact theory andso that went from i had 3 000 employeesyour position matters you get a lot ofdeference uh you&amp;#39;ve got a privilegedparking space you know what i mean likethere&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that gointo it andbut i didn&amp;#39;t none of like my rewardsystem was tied to that so it was veryeasy for me to start the next day withthere was only seven of us and no onehad time for any deference of any kindand i went from having an ea which youcan&amp;#39;t imagine how amazing that is to notand you&amp;#39;re doing everything for yourselfagainbut that wasn&amp;#39;t a painful thing becausei was so focused on all right cool thisis step one again and now can can werepeat well it helps if you can expectthat there will be a little bit of a dippost win or postwhatever um that&amp;#39;s helpful there&amp;#39;salways a refractory period of any kindso to speak if you expect it that&amp;#39;sgreat because you eliminate the thedownside of the reward prediction errorreward prediction error can also beconceptualized as i tell you we&amp;#39;re goingto go this restaurant i keep building upthe food building up the food i actuallyraised the expectation and therequirement that that food be reallyspectacular better off i just tell youit&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty good and thenyou&amp;#39;re wowed by it right because if yourdopamine was higher in anticipation thanthe actual food evoked well then itmakes sense why would you&amp;#39;re alwaysintegrating over the dopamine releaseyou had previouslynow there are a couple things that yousaid in there that i want to highlightwhich i find so interesting uh and wecan get a little biteastern philosophy mystical here but tieit back to some real neuroscience whichis you said you know that&amp;#39;s the juicethe motivation is the juice you knowthatif you look at eastern philosophy andthey talk about qi you know in this youknow what is that i i wager that isdopamine the desire to pursue things andto create more of oneself andas a species whether or not you decideto have kids or not those circuits alluse the one universal currency dopamineof wanting more things that are outsidethe confines of your skin and that&amp;#39;swhat&amp;#39;s driven forward evolution ofindividuals andfamilies and cultures and our ourspecies as a whole and again thecircuitry has been there for many manytens if not hundreds of thousands ofyearsand so it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s highly conservedand so what that means is that itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s bitcoin orethereum it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;sputting rockets on other planets itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s building thefirst automobile it&amp;#39;s the same currencyso understanding those cycles is reallykey the other thing is the element ofpain i think that understanding thatpain and pleasure and this reallydynamic balancecan also help us which in the followingwayany pain that you feel the longer daythe less sleep the the kind of agonythat things aren&amp;#39;t working that poweroutlet doesn&amp;#39;t work or the internet isslow whatever it isthe amount of pleasure that you willeventually experienceis directly relation related excuse meto how much pain you experience so weknow this from actually what nowadayswould be considered quite barbaric andunethical experiments where they wouldgive people electrical shocksand they would measure their responseand then they&amp;#39;d say we&amp;#39;re going toincrease it we&amp;#39;re going to increase iteventually they get to the point where aslight shock that was previously verypainful actually evokes a sense ofpleasurenow you couldn&amp;#39;t do these experimentsanymore these are not the experiments ido in my labthese are older experiments butfor instance and this has been discussedin scientific research papers uh givingsomebody a like a 10-minute ice bath forinstance or even a three-minute ice bathor a one-minute ice bath it&amp;#39;s quitepainful but there was a study from theuniversity of prague uh european journalphysiology showed that after a painfulice bath stimulusthe amount of dopamine release goes upfor two and a half hours to 250 percentabove baseline and that&amp;#39;s not becausethe ice bathitself evokes dopamine release a lot ofpeople think oh cold water of oxdopamine release no pain evokes dopaminerelease after the pain is over yesterdayi tweaked my back because i do thisstupid thing every few years the samestupid thing and it&amp;#39;s really painful andthen you just remember all the ways inwhich you can&amp;#39;t move around i was likestanding up this morning like ah andjust walking is so painful as the painhas started to dissipate you get alittle bit of a high right you get alittle bit of a euphoria that&amp;#39;s dopaminebecause of the the degree of pain youexperienced previously predicts how muchpleasure so when you start a companydown in the dregs and you&amp;#39;re shovelingagainthat&amp;#39;s beautiful because that means thatthe wind that you achieveis going to be as good or greater thanthe one you had previously in your casewith quest and so we go back to thisexample the person that&amp;#39;s not motivatedthat can&amp;#39;t get off the couch thatdoesn&amp;#39;t want to do anything well this isthe problem we remember the radexperiment they are effectively the ratwith no dopamine but they can stillachievesome sense of pleasureby consuming excess calories byconsuming social media and look i&amp;#39;m notjudging i do this stuff too rightscrolling social media if you&amp;#39;ve everscrolled social media and you&amp;#39;re like idon&amp;#39;t even know why i&amp;#39;m doing this itdoesn&amp;#39;t really feel that goodand i can remember a time where you&amp;#39;dsee something it was just so cool or yousee something online i remember thiswhen ted talks first came out i was likethis is amazing these are some at leastsome of them are really smart peoplesharing really cool insights and thennow that they&amp;#39;re like a gazillion tedtalks i remember spending a winter in myoffice at when i was a junior professorcleaning my office finallyand binging ted talks in the backgroundthinking this is a good use of my timepretty soon they all sucked to me i waslike this isn&amp;#39;t good so what you need todo is stop watching dead docs for awhilewait and then they become interestingagain and that&amp;#39;s this pain pleasurebalanceand so for people that aren&amp;#39;t feelingmotivated the problem is they&amp;#39;re notmotivated but they&amp;#39;re getting justenough or excess sustenance so they&amp;#39;regetting the little mild hits of opioidit becomes an opioid system and if youthink about the opioid drugs as opposedto dopamine dopaminergic drugsdopaminergic drugs make people rabid foreverything you know drugs of abuse likecocaine amphetamine make peopleincredibly outward directed or theyhardly notice anything except what theywant more of more more it&amp;#39;s veryit&amp;#39;s badbecause those drugs trigger so muchdopamine release that they become thereward it&amp;#39;s very circular that only thedrug can give that much dopamine nothingthey could pursue would give them asmuch dopamine as the drug itselfso there&amp;#39;s that and then there&amp;#39;s thekind of opioid like effectsof constantly indulging oneself withsocial media or with video games or withwith food or with anything to the pointwhere it no longer evokes the motivationand craving and this is really the newevolution of the understanding ofdopamine and neuro in neuroscience whichis that dopamine itself is not thereward it&amp;#39;s the build-up to the rewardand the reward has more of a kind ofopioid bliss-like property which itselfis not bad if it&amp;#39;s endogenous releasedfrom within but when we can just sitthere like the like the rat with nodopamine gorging ourselves withpleasures so to speak what you end upwith is somebody that feels reallyunmotivated and those pleasures nolonger work to tickle those feel-goodcircuits and so there&amp;#39;s no reason forthem to go out and pursue anything andthat&amp;#39;s a pretty dark picture so the thekeys areto pursue rewards but understand thatthe pursuit is actually the rewardif you want to have repeatedwins okay you the celebration has to beless than the pursuit and that&amp;#39;s hardfor some people to dothey you know they it&amp;#39;s got to be thatyour celebration is slightly lessdopaminergicit can be very reflective you can be ingratitude those are otherneurotransmitter systems but you don&amp;#39;twant to be on that high as you celebratethe windyou want to betrickling out your dopamineregularly until you pursue things andthen just understand there will alwaysbe a crash of pain and the more pain youexperience the more dopamine you canachieve if you get back on the avenue ofperfect yeah this gets into unintendedconsequences of modernity and so we&amp;#39;reliving through this time where we youknow going back to that flag that weplanted of these unintended consequencesof oh i can make myself smell good oh ican you know watch the coolest video ohlike tick tockdude i don&amp;#39;t have an addictivepersonality that&amp;#39;s the first thing wherei&amp;#39;ll lose an hour and be like what the[ __ ] did i just do well that&amp;#39;sthe problem is not pleasures the problemis that pleasure experienced withoutprior requirement for pursuit yesisterrible for us it&amp;#39;s terrible for us asindividuals it&amp;#39;s terrible for us as asgroups and i have great confidence inthe human species to work this out butwe are finding now and we are going toincreasingly find that those who will besuccessful young or old are going to bethose people who can create their owninternal buffers they&amp;#39;re going to beable to control their relationship topleasures because the proximity topleasures and their availability is theproblem if you look atthe increase inuse of drugs of abuse or prescriptionmedication which at least at the firstpass deliver pleasure pain relief thewhole issue with the opioid crisis andand dopaminergic drugs like ritalinadderallyou know there is sometimes there&amp;#39;s aclinical need but tons of people aretaking those recreationally now or tostudy huge dopamine increases are whatthose causethat is a problem that&amp;#39;s a seriousproblem because it creates a cycle whereyou you need more of that specific thingi always say addictionis a progressive narrowing of the thingsthat bring you pleasure that&amp;#39;s such agood difference and you know and i don&amp;#39;tlike to comment too much onenlightenment because you know i don&amp;#39;treally know what that is as aneurobiologist but a good life we couldsay is a progressive expansion of thethings that bring you pleasure and evenbetter is a good life is a progressiveexpansion of the things that bring youpleasure and includes pleasure throughmotivation and hard work andunderstanding this pain pleasure balancewhereby if you experience pain and youcan continue to be in that friction andexert effortthe rewards are that much greater whenthey arriveand soi think that if you look at any drug ofabuse or any situation where somebodyisn&amp;#39;t motivated or thinks that now theymay have clinically diagnosed attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder but a lotof what people think is adhd it turnsout is people just over consumingdopamine from various sources and thenand also the context within a tick tockfeed is the context switch is insane thebrain has never seen first of allthere&amp;#39;s a first time in human evolutionthat we wrote with our thumbs but that&amp;#39;sa pretty benign shift and that the othershift isnormally you walk from one room toanother or from a field into the treesor from a hut into or a house orwhatever it is but now you can get 10000 context switches in that 30 minutesof scrolling on instagram or to talk andso it&amp;#39;s all about self-regulation we aregoing to select for the people that canself-regulate andso then people say well how do youself-regulate how do kids self-regulatewell this is my hope and one of thereasons i&amp;#39;ve gotten excited about publiceducation and teaching neuroscience isthatthis is a place where knowledge ofknowledge actually can allow oneself tointervene when you think i&amp;#39;m feeling lowi don&amp;#39;t feel good nothing really feelslike am i depressed maybe but maybeyou&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;ve saturated thedopamine circuits you&amp;#39;re now in the painpart of things what do you do well youhave to stop you need you need toreplenish dopamine you need to stopengaging with this behavior and thenyour pleasure for it will come back butyou have to constantly control the hingeit&amp;#39;s not just about being back and forthon the seesaw you have to make sure thehinge doesn&amp;#39;t get stuck in pain or inpleasure so it&amp;#39;s a dynamic process beinga human being it&amp;#39;s not easy and rememberthese circuits didn&amp;#39;t evolve for thispurposethey evolve primarily formaking more of ourselves that&amp;#39;s whythey&amp;#39;re so closely tied to thereproductive circuits and that&amp;#39;s why itwas interesting and very relevant thatyou said that yourdesire to have sex with your wife is oneof the most powerful feelings and itkind of as a from a neurochemicalperspective it wicks out into all theseother pursuits right those otherpursuits aren&amp;#39;t about sex per se butit&amp;#39;s the same molecules so the feelingis the same it&amp;#39;s just that some peoplefor some people the amplitude of thatdopamine signal for craving sex is veryhigh for some people that&amp;#39;s lower andit&amp;#39;s higher for um video games you knowwhatever you lean intoand and youthink about oftenin these pursuits we&amp;#39;ll start to reshapethese circuits because thesedopaminergic circuits are tied toeverything you know there are examplesof people getting addicted to the mostincredible things they&amp;#39;re also examplesof people getting very good but notaddicted to chess for instance it&amp;#39;s allthe samegeneral set of mechanismsyeah you talked earlier aboutthe the knowledge of knowledge and thatwas the big breakthrough for me at thedarkest period of my life i happened tograb a book we talked about this brieflyin our first interview i happened tograb a book that talked aboutneuroplasticity and they werehypothesizing maybe this is a thingandthatgave me hope because i could imaginewhat was going on in my brain and once ican visualize it then i feel like i caninsert myself into it it&amp;#39;s why i&amp;#39;vegotten so interested in health why i&amp;#39;mso interested in neuroscienceis for me if i were sliding towardsdepression i would do exactly whatyou&amp;#39;re saying i would assess that and belike okay wait a second i know that ican insert conscious control i know thatthis is abiological experience and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;mobsessed with that idea that you&amp;#39;rehaving a biological experience and to melike there&amp;#39;s some people that see theway the magic trick is done and it losesthe magic then for other people it&amp;#39;slike you see that it&amp;#39;s this is somebodythat&amp;#39;s spent 30 000 hours learning howto move their hands so that you don&amp;#39;tnotice that they just move the coin youknow from this hand to this hand it&amp;#39;sit blows me away i love magic uh beforethe pandemic a friend took me up to themagic castle here in hollywood andthere&amp;#39;s some incredible stuff going onmagic is actually really cool we coulduh just as a from a neuroscienceperspective magic it&amp;#39;s all aboutcreating gaps in your perception that&amp;#39;sobvious rightand when that happens because the thebrain is so accustomed to the laws ofphysics like objects fall down not upetc when that happens it clearlytriggers the surprise circuitry and thatitself that feeling of delight andsurprise is absolutely tied also tothese dopamine dopamine circuits it&amp;#39;sinteresting though that that doesn&amp;#39;tsend us into like terror like the peopledepends on the magic trick when i wentthere there was this crazy trick thatthe guy did he took out cards and i wasinvited up to sit next to him i signedmy name on a cardi took the card i took the cardi tore it up i put it in my pocketand at the end of the show we wentthrough a series of things at the end ofthe show hetook off his shoe and presented the cardto me with the signature intact and thecard intact and that was my signatureso he clearly created gaps of perceptionum but at some point as adults so ithink as long as we know the context isright then we can we can do this onething about dopamine that i just want tomake sure iuh mention and it based on something yousaid earlier is thatone interesting question about the brainis just asking the question you know howdo we segment time how do we how do youknow that this podcast has obviously hasa beginning in the middle and an end butyou know how do we segment time and sothere have been some beautifulexperiments done recently showing thatuh for instance if you&amp;#39;re watching asports game regardless of whether or notyour team scores like let&amp;#39;s saybasketball goes down court let&amp;#39;s saythey missed the three-pointer and thenyou know it&amp;#39;s a close game there&amp;#39;s alittle blip of dopamine that says thatwas one segment of timeand so dopamine is a big way in which wesegment time the other way are blinksbelieve it or notyeah that every time we blink there&amp;#39;s apaper publishing current biology everytime we blink we reset our perception ofthat when i understand more i guess thanthe dopamine why would dopamine beinvolved in time perfect question turnsout that the frequency of blinking isset by the level baseline level ofdopamine in the brain yes so when peopleare wide-eyed with excitement andthey&amp;#39;re and they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re notblinking very often or someone is on adrug that kicks out a lot of dopaminethey hardly ever blink their pupils arehugethey&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re actually not segmentingtime in the normal fashionand so much of your life in retrospectis segmented by those peaks and dopaminethey those mark key events in your lifewhen you met your wife uh that theirtheirall the segments of your life are arenoted by peaks and dopamine or the waythat you happen to conceptualizedopamine and so also people who aredepressed are often very focused on thepast they ruin naturally they default toruminating on the past when you adjustpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine levels to healthylevels they start becoming more forwardthinking and more present and so there&amp;#39;sthis relationship between blinking andtime perception dopamine and blinkinghow you conceptualize time has a lot todo with these peaks and dopamine andwhen they occurand this is a big deal because we&amp;#39;re youknow 2020 was a rough year for mostpeople 2021&amp;#39;s feeling a little betterbut we don&amp;#39;t really know where we are inthis whole arc of everything that&amp;#39;shappeningthere&amp;#39;s a lot of uncertainty yeahthe dopamine peaks and the frequency ofthose dopamine peaks have everything todo with how we carve up our experienceof time and anyone who spent a lot oftime in deep meditationstarts to develop a kind of intuitiveinternal representation of the fact thattime is very fluid in this way when wesay time is fluid what we mean is thesecretion of dopamine and these pulsesis very fluid they are under control ofour of what&amp;#39;s happening externally butalso how you conceptualize your lifelike where are you in your life are youyou know hopefully we&amp;#39;ll if davidsinclair has his way and hopefully hewill we will all live to be you knowmore than a hundred years oldhopefully in good vitality so this isthe more esoteric aspect of dopaminereal fast before we go about the timething yeah let me ask you so there was aperiod in my life i&amp;#39;ll take it at abouttwo years where for whatever reason i itcould have been six hours since i lastlooked at a clock i would be withinthree minutes of what time it was and mywife found it hilarious and so she&amp;#39;d belike what time is it and i&amp;#39;m like ohit&amp;#39;s 4 58.it was so weird that it like made myradar is like oh my god i have like thisspecial power and then it went awayand now i can probably get you within 15minutes but like uh it was really eerieis is there does that make a predictionor a round likea consistency of dopamine release orsomething yeah you nailed it it&amp;#39;s theconsistency that&amp;#39;s an internal it&amp;#39;s aninterval timer as we say so whenpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine is low they tend tooverestimate okay okayand when people&amp;#39;s dopamine is high theytend to underestimate time now it istrue that dopamine when it&amp;#39;s released isa little bit of a stimulant in thesystem because of the way it works withepinephrine how finely you slice time isvery dependent on dopamine and yourinternal level of autonomic arousal areally good example would be you&amp;#39;rereally excited about something or you&amp;#39;rereally stressed about something doesn&amp;#39;tmatter dopamine iselevated in excitement butnorepinephrine epinephrine tend to beelevated any time we&amp;#39;re agitated or orexcitedjust imagine you need to catch a flightyou&amp;#39;re in line at the security and theperson in front of you seems likethey&amp;#39;re going really really slowly yourframe rate is faster you&amp;#39;re just carvingup time more finely people are in caraccidents and then they reporteverything being in slow motion yourframe rate is issmaller you&amp;#39;re essentially gettingyou&amp;#39;re taking larger time bins and thisis why let&amp;#39;s say you wake up and you&amp;#39;rereally tired or you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re kindof out of it and you look and it&amp;#39;s liketext messages and emails and all thisstuff the world seems like it&amp;#39;s going byreally really fastdopamine is what is the diagno is thedynamic process by dopamine release ishould say is the dynamic process bywhich you adjust time perception so ifyou had a very keen perception of thepassage of time right down to the minuteor so that suggests very regularintervals of dopamine release and that&amp;#39;sprobably tied to outside events that arebelow your conscious awarenessbutuh dopamine releases i i sort ofnot to make this uh pg-13 or r-rated butif we go back to the example of sex sexand sleep are the two times when spaceand time have a very fluid typerelationship it&amp;#39;s veryhard to conceive space and time in sleepthat&amp;#39;s actually the nature of sleep iswe do the long blink no joke we closethe shutters stop bringing in externalinformation and in sleep space and timeare veryfluid right things can happen very fastor very slow slow motion you can beflying it there&amp;#39;s a lot of you know someof it is dreaming but space and time arevery fluid in wakefulnessspace and time are very anchored byphysical events in the world but ourperception of those is dynamicallyregulated by how much dopamine is in oursystem so it&amp;#39;s beginning to sound likedopamine does everything but it&amp;#39;s reallyassociated with motivation craving andtime interval keeping and so i would bewilling to bet that your pulses ofdopamine were very regular just likedropsso interesting so we do a lot of thingswho knows what i was doing at thatperiod if it had to do anything justthat i&amp;#39;m getting older and so it startsto disrupt itself who knows butwhat are some things so one thing i&amp;#39;veheard you talk about which i find reallyinterestingwhen i think about all the things thatwe&amp;#39;re doing that are disrupting thingsall these unintended consequences ofmodern behaviori am truly glad thatcell phones the internet and pornographydid not exist when i was younger becausei don&amp;#39;t know if at 14i could have been disciplined enough ifi had access to that andwhat like when you think about thethings that we&amp;#39;re doing right now thatare sort of the that have maybe the mostgrand unintended consequences where doyou landyeah on the time scale of 24 hours oneof the the huge mistakes that we allmake and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;ve said this many timesso if people have heard me say thisbefore forgive me but it turns out it&amp;#39;sstill trueuhgetting too much bright light exposurefrom the hours of 10 pm until 4 amunless you have to work shift work whichis a unique casethat bright light exposure between 10 pmand 4 am even if youadjust the colors of the lights youstill need to get everything reallyreally dim because it actuallyblocks the release of dopamine through apathway that involves a structure calledthe habenulathe habenula was a kind of crypticstructure in the brain for a long timebut now we know there&amp;#39;s a punishmentsignal in the brain you getneurochemically punishedfor viewing bright light at those hourshow how would that be wired in we&amp;#39;dnever be able to expose ourselves tobright light ah so that&amp;#39;s a greatquestion so firelight won&amp;#39;t do thatmoonlight&amp;#39;s fine candles lights that aredim are now in your environmentso the the pathway to the habenula andthen to these dopamine reducing circuitsare the pain pathway that we&amp;#39;rereferring to earlier it&amp;#39;s a genericpathway through which lots of differenttypes of signals and stimuli and eventscan punish us internally this is so gooddude and so i&amp;#39;m going to call this therich kid effectlike there and you mentioned hard workearlier there is a reason i think thatchildren of wealthy parents end upimploding because there is a anevolutionary the punishment pathwayevolutionary thing that&amp;#39;s going on thatsays you didn&amp;#39;t have to work hard forthe things that you own and because fromuh i need you to go hunt and gather andface a saber-toothed tiger i have toreward you for doing hard things andpunish you for not doing hard thingswell andyou know in the case of the thethe generic model of the of the spoiledrich kid it they actually can&amp;#39;t accessdopamine uh remember that that a moviefrom the 80s it was a uh it was calledlike the toy or something with richard iwas like if this [ __ ] says toyi&amp;#39;m gonna have a seizure yesrichard pryor in that movie and the kidhas everything and he&amp;#39;s the he&amp;#39;s theepitome of the spoiled brat all the toysall the cars all the things now we seethis with people who actually go fromrags to riches and then bathe in alltheir the luxuries they didn&amp;#39;t have as achild these are often the athletes thatdon&amp;#39;t go on to perform well againthese are people that crash because ofother dopamine-seeking behaviors youknow i&amp;#39;m not going to call out names butthere are far too many examples of theseand i don&amp;#39;t call out names mostlybecause we are all capable of this weall would like to think that oh if i hadall that money or if i had all thatsuccess i would really be a good humanbeing and i wouldn&amp;#39;t do those thingsanyone any human being that is immersedin these dopamine circuits too much orwho gets too much pleasure withouthaving to pursue it first and reallywork andactually experience pain pleasureratcheting back and forth along thatclimb because it wasn&amp;#39;t just dopaminelike this for you it&amp;#39;s probably painpleasure pain pleasure painpleasure pain right they&amp;#39;re alwaysproportional to one anotherso anyone that does that it has atremendously hard time accessingpleasurethey can&amp;#39;t do that and and we oftenthink about the extremes of addictionand those are really severe but we alsohave to think about the more subtleforms of something we really love butindulging in it just a little too oftenso that it no longer has that edgeyou know there have been really goodstudies of people who jump out ofairplanes with parachutes you knowi&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun it looks likea thrill but people do over and over andover againoften diedoing other things they often becomedrug addicts because it&amp;#39;s a huge high ohyeah yeah a lot of thatand you know there are a lot of examplesof this i mean you can get addicted toanything the key is to regulate thatbehavior so you asked whatyou know what should people do wellcertainlyi&amp;#39;m trying this now and i have some goodexamples some young people i know andwork with are taking breaks from notjust social media but no cell phonewhatsoever i&amp;#39;m actually trying an oddexperiment which isfor the first hour of every day no phonemostly because part of your 25 no-gosyesright so we have circuitry in the brainrelated to the so-called basal gangliaand we have go sort of activating youknow think gas pedal and then we there&amp;#39;sa lot of no go circuitryandlearning how to keep that no go don&amp;#39;tcircuitry as we could call ituh tuned up is very important and somany times throughout the day but i tryand get 25 a day where i activelyrefrain from doing something that iimpulsively want to do could be lookingat my phone but it could even besomething trivial like i want to walk tothe kitchen and get a glass of water soi&amp;#39;m actively engaging inself-denin denial not cognitive denial probablythat too but how would i know um but inaction-based denial so restricting mybehavior in some way as a way of keepingthese dopamine circuits tuned up alsonot looking at my phone first thing inthe morning for an hour becauseknowing what we now know about thesecond phase of sleep and rem sleepbeing more predominant the second waveof sleep and the fact that you&amp;#39;reworking through a lot of emotional andlogistical contingencies you&amp;#39;rereshaping your brain in sleep that&amp;#39;swhen neuroplasticity occurs during sleepit&amp;#39;s triggered in wakefulness but itactually takes place in sleep especiallythat second half of sleepwhen you wake up in the morning you arein a perfect position to what i callreceive the download of all the workthat your neural circuitry has beendoing the night before but if youimmediately go to a sensory experienceespecially a rich sensory experience ofstuff scrolling by you&amp;#39;re actuallymissing the information that youprocessed at night and even moreimportantly that second half of thenight during rem sleep is when theemotional weight of things start becomeslet&amp;#39;s sayyou put it on the shelf properly thingsthat are important to emotionalemotionally registered get put in oneshelf things that were like the commentyou got on twitter that was triggeringdoesn&amp;#39;t seem like such a big deal aftera good night&amp;#39;s sleep and that&amp;#39;s becausethat second half of sleep is actuallywhen you re-experience these things butyour body can&amp;#39;t secrete adrenaline it&amp;#39;skind of an internal form of therapy oreven trauma therapy and that&amp;#39;s whypeople who don&amp;#39;t get that sleep are veryyou know they&amp;#39;re easily agitated theyfeel like the world is crushing down onthem so when i wake up in the morning iwant to receive ideas that i want tolearn from my learning and if you takein new information you are not in aposition to do that and 60 minutes is atough one so i give myself two no-gosfor the 60-minute block if i can do itand i&amp;#39;ll tell you a lot of mornings ifail tom i don&amp;#39;t do it interesting ijust i found that shocking but i heardyou say that in another interview and iwas like well i mean i&amp;#39;m human you knowthere are mornings whereum i get enticed or worseworse i find myself reflexively pickingup without having made the consciousdecision and that&amp;#39;s wheni realized thatyou know we are alldeep in this process and i thinkuh we have to regulate it the theexperiment i&amp;#39;d like to do maybe you&amp;#39;lldo this with me as a challenge becausethe challenge is always good is in thenew year i actually want to take everyodd waking hour of the day off the phoneso even hours of the dayas long as it&amp;#39;s waking i&amp;#39;m willing tohave it on and work with it but oddhours just turn it off no matter whati don&amp;#39;t know if this will destroy mostof the relationshipsbut just to see can i do it on a rigidlyexternally imposed schedule because ifyou think about most of the growth inlife comes from these rigidly externallyimposed schedules and we hate thembut they are where we learn restraintdude this is so important i don&amp;#39;t knowif i hate them anymore so people willoften ask like how i do this that or theother whatever it is like tom how do youumso i work 93 hours a week that&amp;#39;s like myaverage that&amp;#39;s your average sotom why do you work 93 hours every weekand the answer is because 93 are joyfuland 94 wouldn&amp;#39;tandwhen i start working more than that itusually means that i&amp;#39;m juggling so manythings that my brain seems to be usingsleep as a way to track some of them orsomething yeah so i find myself wakingup a lot no i have a trick that allowsme to fall back asleep very fast butit&amp;#39;s still not as restful as justsleeping through the night what&amp;#39;s thetrick if you don&amp;#39;t mind me entering idon&amp;#39;t at all so i have two pairs ofairpod headphonesand i put them inand i put them on a uhfiction book and i turn the volume downsuch that if i don&amp;#39;t put a little bit ofpressure on my ear i can&amp;#39;t make out whatthey&amp;#39;re saying so as soon as i drift offthe pressure releases and i can stillhear that noise is being made but ican&amp;#39;t track it and so i&amp;#39;m usually outprobably in about three minutes wow thatthat changed my life in terms of when iget stressed i can still fall backasleep such a great skill and justreflecting on what you usethat murmur in the background and thiskind of low level i can&amp;#39;t quite detectit is actually the way that your braindetects things as you&amp;#39;re falling asleepso i wonder if you&amp;#39;ve triggered yourcircuit to run in reverse where youactually can send yourself back underwhat what it makes me think is that ican&amp;#39;tprocess the problemsand listen to a story at the same timeand so my brain clicks over into storymode and it&amp;#39;s like oh we&amp;#39;re digestingthis story i i&amp;#39;m getting input sobecause i&amp;#39;m getting input because it&amp;#39;sstory my brain lets go of i have tosolve problems and then that allows meto fall right back asleep that&amp;#39;s greatsuch a great skill and waking up in themiddle of the night from time to time touse the bathroom is actually quitenormaland some people are really obsessed bythe fact oh no i woke up and then theyget triggered but i learned this lastyear umthat thepeak in our alertness is actually about90 minutes before our natural bedtimeand a lot of people they you know theyreach the point in the evening wherethey&amp;#39;reready to go to sleep and then they feelall this you know excitement and surgeof energy and they think oh no i&amp;#39;m notgoing to be able to fall asleep butthat&amp;#39;s actually a natural surge that&amp;#39;sfollowed by a dip a lot of people alsohave the trouble of waking up in themiddle of the night and wondering whythey can&amp;#39;t fall back asleep this isdreadfully hard for a lot of people istruggled that for years yeah and one ofthe solutions is to go to bed earlierbecause it means that your melatonin isstarting to get released early in theevening and so we all have the naturalability to push to stay late stay uplater if we really need to this hasobvious adaptive utility but some peopleby who should go to bed quote unquoteshould go to bed at 9 or 10 p.m they&amp;#39;repushing to 11 or 12 and then theirmelatonin signal is starting to drop offnow they can&amp;#39;t fall asleepor they&amp;#39;re waking up at two or three inthe morning and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re introuble but it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve hitthe right schedule 93 hours is animpressive outputthat&amp;#39;s a lot of years of making anobscene amount of mistakes and to closethe loop on so people how do youaccomplish xyz and the answer is partlyrulesso you have to be obsessed with yourgoal right so for me that&amp;#39;s allobsessions start with a goal what do youwant is that thing exciting andhonorable assuming it&amp;#39;s exciting andhonorable there&amp;#39;s ways to like createfeedback loops which is largely whatwe&amp;#39;ve been talking about today aboutattaching the dopaminergic responsespecifically to the pursuit of thatthing rather than having itandbyto because i&amp;#39;m so excited and because iso believe in the reality of my goalsthat i actually could have them and thathaving them would be awesomei can create rules in my life and then ireally stick to those rules so once i&amp;#39;mvery careful about what rules i put inplace because i have to believe thatthey will actually lead me to this goalthat&amp;#39;s really exciting for me but if ibelieve it then i can put them in andthen also part of my identity is thati&amp;#39;m the type of person that when i set arule i follow it so i can create thisloop of like feeling good about myselfand the thing that i&amp;#39;m pursuing but itreally works and i&amp;#39;m shocked how fewpeople have the kind of rule that you&amp;#39;retalking about in the new year to say heyi&amp;#39;m only going to do odd hours there&amp;#39;sno phone yeah well and like i said i&amp;#39;mnot perfect i&amp;#39;m not as disciplined asyou are about my no goes i try iactually find that tabulating is is kindof funum it&amp;#39;s also fun to get reallytriggering commentsand and to not close the dopamine loopfor them i think if people understood umthe dopamine reward prediction errorthat we could end all the umamplifying comment battles onlinebecause what happens is if someone takesa a jab at you of any kind there&amp;#39;sactually an open dopamine loop waitingfor you to respond and any responseactually gives them that that dopamineresponse of success it&amp;#39;s a little bit ofa it&amp;#39;s like scoring a three-pointer andthe no response actually drops theirdopamine below baseline and that&amp;#39;s itsown form of retaliation and i have to becareful because i don&amp;#39;t want toencourage people to retaliate but anyanything that short-circuits the kind ofmadness of getting pulled intosome online battle that&amp;#39;s totallymeaningless it&amp;#39;s taking people away fromother powerful good things that theycould do in the worldyou know we&amp;#39;ve been talking mainly aboutdopamine and its scheduling and aboutthe fact that it can be attached toanything i thinkmany people find it hard to subjectivelyattach dopamine to something they don&amp;#39;twant to do this is something that uh ifwe&amp;#39;d spoken a year ago i would&amp;#39;ve i myanswer would have been a little bitdifferent to the question of how do youget motivated well one way to do that isif you are good at subjectivelyattachingdopamine to the pursuit just knowingokay i really am hungry for this i&amp;#39;mjust i&amp;#39;m going to tell myself that youknow making you know making it onepercent of the wayis a success and i&amp;#39;m going to keep goingand i&amp;#39;m going to keep ratcheting on andthat&amp;#39;s great if you can do that but forpeople that can&amp;#39;t do that understandingthis relationship with a pleasure painbalance can be more powerful justunderstanding the more friction and painthat you experience the greater thedopamine reward you will get later andthat serves as its own amplifier of thewhole process of pursuing more dopamineand then the other aspect of itis that any time that we&amp;#39;re leaning intoactionyou know it has thepossibility of being an amplifyingprocess or a depleting processand the key to that is making sure thatyou&amp;#39;re balancing the dopamine andepinephrine systems you know epinephrinebeing this molecule of universalcurrency of energy output it could beout of hate or it could be out of loveepinephrine doesn&amp;#39;t care and actuallydopamine doesn&amp;#39;t care none of thesesystems care about us they justwork underneath our underneath ourconscious control but when you start tounderstand thathitting the gas pedal is great buthitting the gas pedal and then comingoff the gas pedal a little bityou can kind of sit in a more relaxedrpm actually allows you to go muchfurther i think that peopleleaning into action is terrific i alwayssay you can either be back on your heelsflat footed or forward center of massthe best situation is actually to beright upright but just know that you canbe forward center of mass at any pointand you know that to take it back to sexand reproduction because it&amp;#39;s a salientexample the arc of of sex is veryinteresting because when you think aboutautonomic arousal it turns out that thethe arousal stage of sex actuallyinvolves release of dopaminebut is what we call parasympatheticdominant it&amp;#39;s actually has to be relaxedenoughin order to occur okay everyone can readbetween the lines on thisorgasm is actuallyai want to say full blown it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s ait is a sympatheticnervous system driven response it&amp;#39;sidentical to the stress system it&amp;#39;sdriven by the same neural circuits asstressand then what comes afterwardthe parasympathetic system goes back upagain it&amp;#39;s that deep relaxation so whydo i say this not to talk about sex tobeyou know to to serve as a highlighterbut rather our species arrived herebecause of this dance between arousaland relaxation arousal and relaxationand one thing we can say for sure aboutevery human being that&amp;#39;s alive now isthat their parents at least oncemastered this dance of relaxed but notand excited but not too excited thenreally excited and then relaxed thatdance was mastered by all of our parentsand that&amp;#39;s what delivered us here tosome extent and so iwhat this means is that all the neuralcircuits from the ones that led to ourconception to the ones that lead to uspursuing goals have thisbalance that&amp;#39;s almost like a like aseesaw right there&amp;#39;s activation and calmactivation and calm and it&amp;#39;s thatdynamic process that&amp;#39;s important tomaster in every endeavor so we use sexas an example but in pursuit of goalsyou have to learn how to pursueshort-term goalsand like the goals within the day make acup of coffee and goal and long-termgoals and when i said dopamine is what&amp;#39;ssetting theyour time perception it&amp;#39;s an intervaltimerwhat you&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s like the twomarshmallow experiment done at stanforddef defer the dopamineand actually if you can turn the waitinginto the dopamine and thenyou can extend out the reward for youknow waiting for the second marshmallow15 minutes later et cetera et cetera andthere are many many examples of this inthe psychology and neuroscienceliterature and i would say finally in2020 we finally as a field got a clearidea of how dopamine is really workingbecause before it was all aboutwork dopamine hit rightsex gives you a

what&amp;#39;s a letdown what&amp;#39;sa celebration andi think one of the most importantfindings in the last few years inneuroscience is thatwhile the molecule dopamine isassociated with rewardit&amp;#39;s more aboutmotivation and cravingthere&amp;#39;s a really classic experiment nowthat people use to demonstrate this taketwo ratsand the rats independently separatecages can lever pressfor fooduh when they can access foodthere&amp;#39;s a little bit of dopamine that&amp;#39;sreleased anytime they get some food sowe always thought that foodlike many other rewardslike food sex warmth when you&amp;#39;re coldcool when you&amp;#39;re too warmis triggering the release of dopaminebutsomeone had the good idea to depletedopamine in one of those animalsand then what you find is that theanimal withoutdopamine still enjoys foodstill enjoys other pleasures so dopamineis not really involved in the enjoymentof those pleasures it&amp;#39;s involved inmotivation because if you make theanimal have to move just one rat&amp;#39;slengthbelieve it or not to get to that leverthe animal with dopamine will work to goget that thing it will work through someeffort to go get the reward whereas theanimal or turns out the human withoutmuch dopaminecan still experience pleasure they cansit on their couch and cram their facewith pleasure inducing calories or whathave you watch pleasure-inducing thingson the television but they have verylittle motivation to go pursue thingsthat will deliver them pleasureso when i say dopamine is the universalcurrencyofeverything what i mean is it&amp;#39;s drivingthe motivation to develop new currencieswhen somebody can sit back and say uhi&amp;#39;ll just throw this number out let&amp;#39;ssay somebody has a hundred thousandbitcoins which presumably now is worthoh my godcertainly more than it was a few yearsagothe way they can register whether or notthey are in a position of wealth or nothas everything to do with the the numberthey see on the screen or in theirbitcoin walletbutthat number is converted into a chemicalsignal that has everything to do withhow much you had previously so so wecould talk about the so-called rewardprediction error how good you feel withan experience has everything to do withhow muchyou had previouslyand dopamine itself is what&amp;#39;s drivingthe human species tocreate these new technologies and sowhile we think of currencies as the goalit&amp;#39;s actually what&amp;#39;s really driven theforward evolution of our our species hasbeen the desire to go seek things beyondthe confines of our skin and when i saythe common currency is dopamine what imean is the molecule dopamine whensecreted in the brain makes us pursuethings build things create things makesus want new things that we don&amp;#39;tcurrently already have and so it has alot of dimensions to it but rather thanthink about dopamine as a signal forreward like a dopamine hit weclassically think to talk about it it&amp;#39;smore accurate really to think aboutdopamine as driving motivation andcraving to go seek rewards that&amp;#39;s therad experiment and it&amp;#39;s a way oftabulating where we are in our life arewe doing well or are we doing poorly andthat happens on very short time scaleslike do you wake up feeling good or doyou wake up feeling kind of loworon long time scales if you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough a long degree or you&amp;#39;re halfwaythrough your life how are you doing howdo you gauge that well it has everythingto do with how much dopamine you werereleasing in the previous days and weeksand years so you&amp;#39;re always comparing andall of this is subconscious but what&amp;#39;scool is that once you make theseprocesses conscious once you understanda little bit about how dopamine isreleased and how it changes ourperspective and our behavior then youcan actually work with it so it&amp;#39;s one oftheum instances where knowledge ofknowledge actually turns out to be areally useful tooldude that&amp;#39;s crazy to me so one of thethings that i get hit up about all thetime ispeople feel stuckand as you like really push on them tofigure out why they feel stuck they&amp;#39;llbe like yeah i want to do that and but ijust you know i can&amp;#39;t get out of bed ori don&amp;#39;t have the energy to pursue it orwhatever andyou get into thiscommon thing that people say in mindsetand i really believe it but i find itfar more interesting when you&amp;#39;re talkingabout it from a neuro chemicalstandpoint which is you just don&amp;#39;t wantit badly enoughand when i think aboutmy own life i sometimes worrythat i&amp;#39;m either more malleable thanother people or that i have a greaterability to manipulate my dopaminerelease or whateverbecause i&amp;#39;m very good at building desireand i like the way that desire feels nowwhen you use the word hunger i thinkpeople get confused because i actuallydon&amp;#39;t enjoy being hungry for food i findthat totally unpleasurablehowever being hungry for sex i findincredibly i feel alive i feel focused ifeel energized i feel aggressive it&amp;#39;scomplex for sure but i find that feelingincred the the act of wanting somethingin the future in in that kind or inbusiness and trying to build somethingi&amp;#39;ve in fact that&amp;#39;s an interestinginsight into my own selfabouti like to buildanddo

that&amp;#39;s thethe primary trigger for dopamine releaseyeah now sex and reproduction makes themost sense from the perspective ofevolution uh i mean any species everyspecieshas tends to have two

there are alot of things to manage so this makessense this is true in rodents this istrue in humans and then in terms of thebiology of the father we now know thatwhen because typically parents have

increase in the hormone prolactinwhenthe mother is expecting and theprolactin lays down body fat it preparesfor sleepless nights for women it itsparks um the circuitry for milk letdownfor for nursingso the dad bod has a lot to do withprolactin this is true in in birds insmall mammals and in humans and this isnow there was a paper published innatureon humans specifically about this andwhen you think about the relationshipbetween dopamine and prolactin it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;sinteresting and it takes us back to thismotivation and craving that you weredescribing earlier which is thatdopamine and prolactin work in inopposite fashionso the the most salient example of thisis sex and reproduction whereanticipation of sex and reproductiongreatly increases dopaminebut postsreproductivepost-sex it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be forreproduction there&amp;#39;s a spark inprolactin in the mail that&amp;#39;s the spikeexcuse me in prolactin and that spike inprolactin is

to just stay in this arenaof of of thought is that a guy by thename of gnome sobel who&amp;#39;s at theweizmann institute he used to be atberkeley he has a lab over in israel hisamazing lab works on olfactionsmell and they discovered that the scentof women&amp;#39;s tears causes a dramatic andsignificant reduction in testosterone inmen what absolutely and this waspublished if anyone wants to go look itup it was published in science magazineyou know you can smell tears yeah wehave you know the super bowl ofpublishing and science is science natureand self those are the three topjournals this is published in sciencemagazine very stringent uh the smell oftears now it&amp;#39;s subconscious at somelevelbut the other thing that if we weregoing to kind of play around in thishormones and behave interactions betweenhumans um there are some reallyinteresting examples so for instancemenwill rate the smell of a woman&amp;#39;s skin orsweat or the perception of her face asmore beautiful during the pre-ovulatoryphase of her menstrual cyclethat pre-ovulatory phase is associatedwith a number of different changes inhormones okayjust that smell will increasetestosterone in a maleoral contraception in the femalewomen taking oral contraception itadjusts their hormones such that men nolonger detect this change inhow attractive women are doesn&amp;#39;t meanthey find them unattractive but it meansthey don&amp;#39;t find them increasinglyinteractive during this certain periodof the of their of their menstrual cycleso we are constantly signaling back andforth through hormones in fact we metover thereand shook hands because we&amp;#39;ve beentested for covet and the rest we shookhands andwhat happened and what happens within 30seconds of any human being contactingone another is they shake hands and thenthey wipe their the chemicals of theother person on their facegnome&amp;#39;s lab has also shown this and sowe are constantly signaling throughthrough chemical exchange sometimes it&amp;#39;ssubconscious and those are the so-calledpheromone effects sometimes it&amp;#39;s lowlevels of odors that are beneath ourconscious detection and sometimes it&amp;#39;soutright wow this person smells reallyreally good or they look particularlygood today oftentimes that&amp;#39;s tied to theof the period in which they areovulating in their menstrual cycle so iwant to plant a flag here about all thethings that we dothat aremessing with these mechanisms likecologne or deodorant or oralcontraception of which i&amp;#39;m not saying ispornography like all interception hasserved a great role in it for certainpeople some people might say was this anethical discussion or is it good is itbad but um either way it is having aneffect right so to remove i only look atthings through the lens of biology notthrough the lens of of whether or not weshould or shouldn&amp;#39;t do things i love itokay so we&amp;#39;re planning that we&amp;#39;re comingback to it but now i want to get to howdo we spike intentionally you&amp;#39;ve talkedabout we can spike testosterone but iwant to know can we spike dopamineyeah so um and you&amp;#39;ve done this so yourexample ofcraving isactually what you crave you crave thefeeling of craving is beautiful becauseit would what it means is that you don&amp;#39;tallow yourself to go so far down the arcof the dopamine trajectory to get to theother source of motivation so there aretwo sources of motivation as it relatesto dopamine and then we can think abouttools that we could export from thesethat are nested in neurobiologythe first is to do what you dowhich is to be able to sense the cravingas its own form of pleasure this haskind of remnants of carol dweck&amp;#39;s growthmindset that you eventually develop apleasure in the seeking and the strivinghas you know uh has flavors of a davidgoggins type approach where where itseems like he gets pleasure from thefriction itself and so there areelements of that you seem to have thatas wellbutif you can start to identify the cravingas its own internally released drug thisthing dopamine that is a source ofmotivation then what you realize is thatcapturing the reward is wonderfulbut attaching dopamine to the reward isactually a little bit dangerousattaching yeah this is celebrating thewin celebrating the win more than thepursuit it actually sets you up forfailure in the future and so this getsus right into something called dopaminereward prediction error and rewardprediction error is basically if youexpect something to be really greatand then it&amp;#39;s not quite that great yourdopamine baseline lowers and nowunderstanding what we know aboutdopamine that means that not only didyou you feel as if you lost because itwasn&amp;#39;t as much a celebration as youthought it would be but it also meansthat you&amp;#39;re starting from a lower placemeaning you are less motivated now thesimpler way to conceptualize this ishave a colleague at stanford she runsthe addiction dual diagnosis clinic atuh her name is dr anna lemke she has abook called dopamine nation that&amp;#39;s outright nowand she&amp;#39;s really described as pleasurepain balance where anytime you have abunch of dopamine and you&amp;#39;re in pursuitpursuit pursuitafter you achieve a win now this couldbe a business win a relationship a winof any kindbutinevitably there&amp;#39;s going to be a tippingback of the scale on the pain side andthat pain side is always going to go alittle bit higher than the dopamine sideso this is what you would feel if youpursued a goal like building a bigcompanyhere it comes here comes the big saleand then there&amp;#39;s the well what now thekind of letdown now if you wait if yousimply wait and stop pursuing dopaminefor a short while the scale starts toresetthe problem is a lot of peopleimmediately roll right into the nextpursuitand then what happens is that scalestarts to get stuck on the pain side alittle bit more a little bit more alittle bit more and pretty soon noamount of seeking will allow you toexperience that craving and motivationso what what does this mean in terms ofan actual tool well first of allif people can do what you do they&amp;#39;regoing to be in a much better position inlife it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s schoolsport relationship any domain of life ifyou can start to register ah thatcraving and that friction and thatdesire that almost kind of low level ofagitation sometimes high level ofagitation that is that i&amp;#39;m trying toimpose my will on the world in abenevolent way we hopethat&amp;#39;s dopamine it&amp;#39;s working with itsclose cousin which is epinephrine whichis adrenaline they are very closecousins in fact dopamine manufacturesepinephrine a lot of people don&amp;#39;t knowthis but adrenaline is actually madefrom the molecule dopamineokay so those two are hanging outtogether it&amp;#39;s like crave work crave workcraving work craving work craving workand then you get the winand some peopleallow the big peak in dopamine to beassociated with the winandsmart peoplelearn to adjust their celebrationinternally right this is all internalyou could throw the biggest party in theworld but as long as you&amp;#39;re kind of inlaid backandlooking at this not letting yourself getmanic crazyyou won&amp;#39;t necessarily crash as hardand pretty soon your system will resetso you take the day you clean up thedishes you relax you go what now i&amp;#39;mfeeling a little low well rather thangoing out and spiking your dopamineagain just wait understand that thescale will reset again give yourself afew days where you&amp;#39;re going to feel alittle kind of underwhelmed thingsaren&amp;#39;t going to be as interestingit&amp;#39;s going to be hard to trigger thatbig release because you just hadthe peakwell if you adjust that you relax youunderstand there&amp;#39;s always a little bitof a postpartum depressionwe sometimes hear about postpartumdepression that&amp;#39;s a clinical thing butthere&amp;#39;s always that kind of today&amp;#39;s notas excitingas the previous days what am i going todo with my life but thenif you let it start ratcheting up againthen what you realize is your capacityto tap into dopamine as a motivator notjust seeking dopamine rewards that isinfinite and i i can say with with greatcertainty that this ishow you were able to build a big companyand sell it how you&amp;#39;ve been able tobuild a successful podcast and sell ithow you constantly seeking becauseseeking is the reward and i think formost people we think of the reward asthe finish line and so the key is to getto the finish line step into the endzone but no end zone dance it&amp;#39;s justlike yep and now i&amp;#39;m gonna go do itagainthat&amp;#39;s really the key that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s thekey to doing it over and over and when isee big athletes oracademics or anyone or musicians andtheyrise and crashit&amp;#39;s clear they&amp;#39;ve lost the touch withthe motivation evoked dopamine andthey&amp;#39;ve lost touch probably because ithasn&amp;#39;t really been described by theneuroscience community until anna hasstarted talking about this stuffpublicly and i&amp;#39;m just kind of echoingwhat she&amp;#39;s beautifully saidsaid much better than i am which is thatyou should always expect that after abunch of pleasure there&amp;#39;s going to bethat low and then that craving how do iget back to there again and the key isyou have to walk the staircase again youdon&amp;#39;t get to do this as a square wavepull you know you don&amp;#39;t get to justascend ascend ascend it&amp;#39;s always updownup a little bit higher down up you knowit&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the functionso um i don&amp;#39;t know if that resonateswith your experience i&amp;#39;m over herefreaking out so you&amp;#39;ve literally justexplained what i will say is the singlemost important loop if you want to besuccessfuland you used wordsattach right you had another one whichwas about your t i forget the exact wordbut you&amp;#39;re taking you&amp;#39;re insertingyourself consciously into the processbecause what i learned very early on andi&amp;#39;m so grateful in the same way that youare grateful that your upbringing wasn&amp;#39;tperfect but it ended up giving you aframe of reference and insights thathave propelled you forward i&amp;#39;m verygrateful that i spent a decade justtrying to get rich that was the statedmission i would say it every day likei&amp;#39;m here to get rich i show up to workto get rich it&amp;#39;s about getting rich richrich rich and it didn&amp;#39;t workand so and my wife pulls me aside andshe&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re now damaging themarriage like you&amp;#39;re just so fiendishlyfocused on the goalthat there&amp;#39;s nothing as integrated inyour life you&amp;#39;re doing something youhate for an end state that may nevercomeand that was so profound and it shook meso deeply and it suddenly became clearthat from a neurological perspectivewhat i wanted was to feel alive and oncei put everything in the pursuit i&amp;#39;m justinterested in can i show up every dayand sincerely pursue this thing which imay never get but i&amp;#39;m gonna honor myselfcelebrate myself big up myself as thebrits would say for just showing uptoday and actually trying to make ithappenand one that&amp;#39;s way more sustainable andthen two you don&amp;#39;tyou don&amp;#39;t get tricked into thinking thatoh when i get this thing that i&amp;#39;ll feelgood because it&amp;#39;s the craving that makesme feel alive so it&amp;#39;s the state ofwanting that is in and of itself thepleasurable act that&amp;#39;s right and soi began to use the metaphor of i&amp;#39;m gonnaclimb this mountain only to want thenext mountain to climb and once i knewthat well then you have to be totallycomfortable dropping back down andstarting all over now the interestingthing and i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m foolingmyself or if i haveso integrated that trickbut the come down isn&amp;#39;t hard for me soi i think my last day at quest was amondayand tuesday i started impact theory andso that went from i had 3 000 employeesyour position matters you get a lot ofdeference uh you&amp;#39;ve got a privilegedparking space you know what i mean likethere&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that gointo it andbut i didn&amp;#39;t none of like my rewardsystem was tied to that so it was veryeasy for me to start the next day withthere was only seven of us and no onehad time for any deference of any kindand i went from having an ea which youcan&amp;#39;t imagine how amazing that is to notand you&amp;#39;re doing everything for yourselfagainbut that wasn&amp;#39;t a painful thing becausei was so focused on all right cool thisis step one again and now can can werepeat well it helps if you can expectthat there will be a little bit of a dippost win or postwhatever um that&amp;#39;s helpful there&amp;#39;salways a refractory period of any kindso to speak if you expect it that&amp;#39;sgreat because you eliminate the thedownside of the reward prediction errorreward prediction error can also beconceptualized as i tell you we&amp;#39;re goingto go this restaurant i keep building upthe food building up the food i actuallyraised the expectation and therequirement that that food be reallyspectacular better off i just tell youit&amp;#39;s gonna be pretty good and thenyou&amp;#39;re wowed by it right because if yourdopamine was higher in anticipation thanthe actual food evoked well then itmakes sense why would you&amp;#39;re alwaysintegrating over the dopamine releaseyou had previouslynow there are a couple things that yousaid in there that i want to highlightwhich i find so interesting uh and wecan get a little biteastern philosophy mystical here but tieit back to some real neuroscience whichis you said you know that&amp;#39;s the juicethe motivation is the juice you knowthatif you look at eastern philosophy andthey talk about qi you know in this youknow what is that i i wager that isdopamine the desire to pursue things andto create more of oneself andas a species whether or not you decideto have kids or not those circuits alluse the one universal currency dopamineof wanting more things that are outsidethe confines of your skin and that&amp;#39;swhat&amp;#39;s driven forward evolution ofindividuals andfamilies and cultures and our ourspecies as a whole and again thecircuitry has been there for many manytens if not hundreds of thousands ofyearsand so it&amp;#39;s and it&amp;#39;s highly conservedand so what that means is that itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s bitcoin orethereum it doesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;sputting rockets on other planets itdoesn&amp;#39;t matter if it&amp;#39;s building thefirst automobile it&amp;#39;s the same currencyso understanding those cycles is reallykey the other thing is the element ofpain i think that understanding thatpain and pleasure and this reallydynamic balancecan also help us which in the followingwayany pain that you feel the longer daythe less sleep the the kind of agonythat things aren&amp;#39;t working that poweroutlet doesn&amp;#39;t work or the internet isslow whatever it isthe amount of pleasure that you willeventually experienceis directly relation related excuse meto how much pain you experience so weknow this from actually what nowadayswould be considered quite barbaric andunethical experiments where they wouldgive people electrical shocksand they would measure their responseand then they&amp;#39;d say we&amp;#39;re going toincrease it we&amp;#39;re going to increase iteventually they get to the point where aslight shock that was previously verypainful actually evokes a sense ofpleasurenow you couldn&amp;#39;t do these experimentsanymore these are not the experiments ido in my labthese are older experiments butfor instance and this has been discussedin scientific research papers uh givingsomebody a like a 10-minute ice bath forinstance or even a three-minute ice bathor a one-minute ice bath it&amp;#39;s quitepainful but there was a study from theuniversity of prague uh european journalphysiology showed that after a painfulice bath stimulusthe amount of dopamine release goes upfor two and a half hours to 250 percentabove baseline and that&amp;#39;s not becausethe ice bathitself evokes dopamine release a lot ofpeople think oh cold water of oxdopamine release no pain evokes dopaminerelease after the pain is over yesterdayi tweaked my back because i do thisstupid thing every few years the samestupid thing and it&amp;#39;s really painful andthen you just remember all the ways inwhich you can&amp;#39;t move around i was likestanding up this morning like ah andjust walking is so painful as the painhas started to dissipate you get alittle bit of a high right you get alittle bit of a euphoria that&amp;#39;s dopaminebecause of the the degree of pain youexperienced previously predicts how muchpleasure so when you start a companydown in the dregs and you&amp;#39;re shovelingagainthat&amp;#39;s beautiful because that means thatthe wind that you achieveis going to be as good or greater thanthe one you had previously in your casewith quest and so we go back to thisexample the person that&amp;#39;s not motivatedthat can&amp;#39;t get off the couch thatdoesn&amp;#39;t want to do anything well this isthe problem we remember the radexperiment they are effectively the ratwith no dopamine but they can stillachievesome sense of pleasureby consuming excess calories byconsuming social media and look i&amp;#39;m notjudging i do this stuff too rightscrolling social media if you&amp;#39;ve everscrolled social media and you&amp;#39;re like idon&amp;#39;t even know why i&amp;#39;m doing this itdoesn&amp;#39;t really feel that goodand i can remember a time where you&amp;#39;dsee something it was just so cool or yousee something online i remember thiswhen ted talks first came out i was likethis is amazing these are some at leastsome of them are really smart peoplesharing really cool insights and thennow that they&amp;#39;re like a gazillion tedtalks i remember spending a winter in myoffice at when i was a junior professorcleaning my office finallyand binging ted talks in the backgroundthinking this is a good use of my timepretty soon they all sucked to me i waslike this isn&amp;#39;t good so what you need todo is stop watching dead docs for awhilewait and then they become interestingagain and that&amp;#39;s this pain pleasurebalanceand so for people that aren&amp;#39;t feelingmotivated the problem is they&amp;#39;re notmotivated but they&amp;#39;re getting justenough or excess sustenance so they&amp;#39;regetting the little mild hits of opioidit becomes an opioid system and if youthink about the opioid drugs as opposedto dopamine dopaminergic drugsdopaminergic drugs make people rabid foreverything you know drugs of abuse likecocaine amphetamine make peopleincredibly outward directed or theyhardly notice anything except what theywant more of more more it&amp;#39;s veryit&amp;#39;s badbecause those drugs trigger so muchdopamine release that they become thereward it&amp;#39;s very circular that only thedrug can give that much dopamine nothingthey could pursue would give them asmuch dopamine as the drug itselfso there&amp;#39;s that and then there&amp;#39;s thekind of opioid like effectsof constantly indulging oneself withsocial media or with video games or withwith food or with anything to the pointwhere it no longer evokes the motivationand craving and this is really the newevolution of the understanding ofdopamine and neuro in neuroscience whichis that dopamine itself is not thereward it&amp;#39;s the build-up to the rewardand the reward has more of a kind ofopioid bliss-like property which itselfis not bad if it&amp;#39;s endogenous releasedfrom within but when we can just sitthere like the like the rat with nodopamine gorging ourselves withpleasures so to speak what you end upwith is somebody that feels reallyunmotivated and those pleasures nolonger work to tickle those feel-goodcircuits and so there&amp;#39;s no reason forthem to go out and pursue anything andthat&amp;#39;s a pretty dark picture so the thekeys areto pursue rewards but understand thatthe pursuit is actually the rewardif you want to have repeatedwins okay you the celebration has to beless than the pursuit and that&amp;#39;s hardfor some people to dothey you know they it&amp;#39;s got to be thatyour celebration is slightly lessdopaminergicit can be very reflective you can be ingratitude those are otherneurotransmitter systems but you don&amp;#39;twant to be on that high as you celebratethe windyou want to betrickling out your dopamineregularly until you pursue things andthen just understand there will alwaysbe a crash of pain and the more pain youexperience the more dopamine you canachieve if you get back on the avenue ofperfect yeah this gets into unintendedconsequences of modernity and so we&amp;#39;reliving through this time where we youknow going back to that flag that weplanted of these unintended consequencesof oh i can make myself smell good oh ican you know watch the coolest video ohlike tick tockdude i don&amp;#39;t have an addictivepersonality that&amp;#39;s the first thing wherei&amp;#39;ll lose an hour and be like what the[ __ ] did i just do well that&amp;#39;sthe problem is not pleasures the problemis that pleasure experienced withoutprior requirement for pursuit yesisterrible for us it&amp;#39;s terrible for us asindividuals it&amp;#39;s terrible for us as asgroups and i have great confidence inthe human species to work this out butwe are finding now and we are going toincreasingly find that those who will besuccessful young or old are going to bethose people who can create their owninternal buffers they&amp;#39;re going to beable to control their relationship topleasures because the proximity topleasures and their availability is theproblem if you look atthe increase inuse of drugs of abuse or prescriptionmedication which at least at the firstpass deliver pleasure pain relief thewhole issue with the opioid crisis andand dopaminergic drugs like ritalinadderallyou know there is sometimes there&amp;#39;s aclinical need but tons of people aretaking those recreationally now or tostudy huge dopamine increases are whatthose causethat is a problem that&amp;#39;s a seriousproblem because it creates a cycle whereyou you need more of that specific thingi always say addictionis a progressive narrowing of the thingsthat bring you pleasure that&amp;#39;s such agood difference and you know and i don&amp;#39;tlike to comment too much onenlightenment because you know i don&amp;#39;treally know what that is as aneurobiologist but a good life we couldsay is a progressive expansion of thethings that bring you pleasure and evenbetter is a good life is a progressiveexpansion of the things that bring youpleasure and includes pleasure throughmotivation and hard work andunderstanding this pain pleasure balancewhereby if you experience pain and youcan continue to be in that friction andexert effortthe rewards are that much greater whenthey arriveand soi think that if you look at any drug ofabuse or any situation where somebodyisn&amp;#39;t motivated or thinks that now theymay have clinically diagnosed attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder but a lotof what people think is adhd it turnsout is people just over consumingdopamine from various sources and thenand also the context within a tick tockfeed is the context switch is insane thebrain has never seen first of allthere&amp;#39;s a first time in human evolutionthat we wrote with our thumbs but that&amp;#39;sa pretty benign shift and that the othershift isnormally you walk from one room toanother or from a field into the treesor from a hut into or a house orwhatever it is but now you can get 10000 context switches in that 30 minutesof scrolling on instagram or to talk andso it&amp;#39;s all about self-regulation we aregoing to select for the people that canself-regulate andso then people say well how do youself-regulate how do kids self-regulatewell this is my hope and one of thereasons i&amp;#39;ve gotten excited about publiceducation and teaching neuroscience isthatthis is a place where knowledge ofknowledge actually can allow oneself tointervene when you think i&amp;#39;m feeling lowi don&amp;#39;t feel good nothing really feelslike am i depressed maybe but maybeyou&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;ve saturated thedopamine circuits you&amp;#39;re now in the painpart of things what do you do well youhave to stop you need you need toreplenish dopamine you need to stopengaging with this behavior and thenyour pleasure for it will come back butyou have to constantly control the hingeit&amp;#39;s not just about being back and forthon the seesaw you have to make sure thehinge doesn&amp;#39;t get stuck in pain or inpleasure so it&amp;#39;s a dynamic process beinga human being it&amp;#39;s not easy and rememberthese circuits didn&amp;#39;t evolve for thispurposethey evolve primarily formaking more of ourselves that&amp;#39;s whythey&amp;#39;re so closely tied to thereproductive circuits and that&amp;#39;s why itwas interesting and very relevant thatyou said that yourdesire to have sex with your wife is oneof the most powerful feelings and itkind of as a from a neurochemicalperspective it wicks out into all theseother pursuits right those otherpursuits aren&amp;#39;t about sex per se butit&amp;#39;s the same molecules so the feelingis the same it&amp;#39;s just that some peoplefor some people the amplitude of thatdopamine signal for craving sex is veryhigh for some people that&amp;#39;s lower andit&amp;#39;s higher for um video games you knowwhatever you lean intoand and youthink about oftenin these pursuits we&amp;#39;ll start to reshapethese circuits because thesedopaminergic circuits are tied toeverything you know there are examplesof people getting addicted to the mostincredible things they&amp;#39;re also examplesof people getting very good but notaddicted to chess for instance it&amp;#39;s allthe samegeneral set of mechanismsyeah you talked earlier aboutthe the knowledge of knowledge and thatwas the big breakthrough for me at thedarkest period of my life i happened tograb a book we talked about this brieflyin our first interview i happened tograb a book that talked aboutneuroplasticity and they werehypothesizing maybe this is a thingandthatgave me hope because i could imaginewhat was going on in my brain and once ican visualize it then i feel like i caninsert myself into it it&amp;#39;s why i&amp;#39;vegotten so interested in health why i&amp;#39;mso interested in neuroscienceis for me if i were sliding towardsdepression i would do exactly whatyou&amp;#39;re saying i would assess that and belike okay wait a second i know that ican insert conscious control i know thatthis is abiological experience and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;mobsessed with that idea that you&amp;#39;rehaving a biological experience and to melike there&amp;#39;s some people that see theway the magic trick is done and it losesthe magic then for other people it&amp;#39;slike you see that it&amp;#39;s this is somebodythat&amp;#39;s spent 30 000 hours learning howto move their hands so that you don&amp;#39;tnotice that they just move the coin youknow from this hand to this hand it&amp;#39;sit blows me away i love magic uh beforethe pandemic a friend took me up to themagic castle here in hollywood andthere&amp;#39;s some incredible stuff going onmagic is actually really cool we coulduh just as a from a neuroscienceperspective magic it&amp;#39;s all aboutcreating gaps in your perception that&amp;#39;sobvious rightand when that happens because the thebrain is so accustomed to the laws ofphysics like objects fall down not upetc when that happens it clearlytriggers the surprise circuitry and thatitself that feeling of delight andsurprise is absolutely tied also tothese dopamine dopamine circuits it&amp;#39;sinteresting though that that doesn&amp;#39;tsend us into like terror like the peopledepends on the magic trick when i wentthere there was this crazy trick thatthe guy did he took out cards and i wasinvited up to sit next to him i signedmy name on a cardi took the card i took the cardi tore it up i put it in my pocketand at the end of the show we wentthrough a series of things at the end ofthe show hetook off his shoe and presented the cardto me with the signature intact and thecard intact and that was my signatureso he clearly created gaps of perceptionum but at some point as adults so ithink as long as we know the context isright then we can we can do this onething about dopamine that i just want tomake sure iuh mention and it based on something yousaid earlier is thatone interesting question about the brainis just asking the question you know howdo we segment time how do we how do youknow that this podcast has obviously hasa beginning in the middle and an end butyou know how do we segment time and sothere have been some beautifulexperiments done recently showing thatuh for instance if you&amp;#39;re watching asports game regardless of whether or notyour team scores like let&amp;#39;s saybasketball goes down court let&amp;#39;s saythey missed the three-pointer and thenyou know it&amp;#39;s a close game there&amp;#39;s alittle blip of dopamine that says thatwas one segment of timeand so dopamine is a big way in which wesegment time the other way are blinksbelieve it or notyeah that every time we blink there&amp;#39;s apaper publishing current biology everytime we blink we reset our perception ofthat when i understand more i guess thanthe dopamine why would dopamine beinvolved in time perfect question turnsout that the frequency of blinking isset by the level baseline level ofdopamine in the brain yes so when peopleare wide-eyed with excitement andthey&amp;#39;re and they&amp;#39;re just they&amp;#39;re notblinking very often or someone is on adrug that kicks out a lot of dopaminethey hardly ever blink their pupils arehugethey&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re actually not segmentingtime in the normal fashionand so much of your life in retrospectis segmented by those peaks and dopaminethey those mark key events in your lifewhen you met your wife uh that theirtheirall the segments of your life are arenoted by peaks and dopamine or the waythat you happen to conceptualizedopamine and so also people who aredepressed are often very focused on thepast they ruin naturally they default toruminating on the past when you adjustpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine levels to healthylevels they start becoming more forwardthinking and more present and so there&amp;#39;sthis relationship between blinking andtime perception dopamine and blinkinghow you conceptualize time has a lot todo with these peaks and dopamine andwhen they occurand this is a big deal because we&amp;#39;re youknow 2020 was a rough year for mostpeople 2021&amp;#39;s feeling a little betterbut we don&amp;#39;t really know where we are inthis whole arc of everything that&amp;#39;shappeningthere&amp;#39;s a lot of uncertainty yeahthe dopamine peaks and the frequency ofthose dopamine peaks have everything todo with how we carve up our experienceof time and anyone who spent a lot oftime in deep meditationstarts to develop a kind of intuitiveinternal representation of the fact thattime is very fluid in this way when wesay time is fluid what we mean is thesecretion of dopamine and these pulsesis very fluid they are under control ofour of what&amp;#39;s happening externally butalso how you conceptualize your lifelike where are you in your life are youyou know hopefully we&amp;#39;ll if davidsinclair has his way and hopefully hewill we will all live to be you knowmore than a hundred years oldhopefully in good vitality so this isthe more esoteric aspect of dopaminereal fast before we go about the timething yeah let me ask you so there was aperiod in my life i&amp;#39;ll take it at abouttwo years where for whatever reason i itcould have been six hours since i lastlooked at a clock i would be withinthree minutes of what time it was and mywife found it hilarious and so she&amp;#39;d belike what time is it and i&amp;#39;m like ohit&amp;#39;s 4 58.it was so weird that it like made myradar is like oh my god i have like thisspecial power and then it went awayand now i can probably get you within 15minutes but like uh it was really eerieis is there does that make a predictionor a round likea consistency of dopamine release orsomething yeah you nailed it it&amp;#39;s theconsistency that&amp;#39;s an internal it&amp;#39;s aninterval timer as we say so whenpeople&amp;#39;s dopamine is low they tend tooverestimate okay okayand when people&amp;#39;s dopamine is high theytend to underestimate time now it istrue that dopamine when it&amp;#39;s released isa little bit of a stimulant in thesystem because of the way it works withepinephrine how finely you slice time isvery dependent on dopamine and yourinternal level of autonomic arousal areally good example would be you&amp;#39;rereally excited about something or you&amp;#39;rereally stressed about something doesn&amp;#39;tmatter dopamine iselevated in excitement butnorepinephrine epinephrine tend to beelevated any time we&amp;#39;re agitated or orexcitedjust imagine you need to catch a flightyou&amp;#39;re in line at the security and theperson in front of you seems likethey&amp;#39;re going really really slowly yourframe rate is faster you&amp;#39;re just carvingup time more finely people are in caraccidents and then they reporteverything being in slow motion yourframe rate is issmaller you&amp;#39;re essentially gettingyou&amp;#39;re taking larger time bins and thisis why let&amp;#39;s say you wake up and you&amp;#39;rereally tired or you&amp;#39;re just you&amp;#39;re kindof out of it and you look and it&amp;#39;s liketext messages and emails and all thisstuff the world seems like it&amp;#39;s going byreally really fastdopamine is what is the diagno is thedynamic process by dopamine release ishould say is the dynamic process bywhich you adjust time perception so ifyou had a very keen perception of thepassage of time right down to the minuteor so that suggests very regularintervals of dopamine release and that&amp;#39;sprobably tied to outside events that arebelow your conscious awarenessbutuh dopamine releases i i sort ofnot to make this uh pg-13 or r-rated butif we go back to the example of sex sexand sleep are the two times when spaceand time have a very fluid typerelationship it&amp;#39;s veryhard to conceive space and time in sleepthat&amp;#39;s actually the nature of sleep iswe do the long blink no joke we closethe shutters stop bringing in externalinformation and in sleep space and timeare veryfluid right things can happen very fastor very slow slow motion you can beflying it there&amp;#39;s a lot of you know someof it is dreaming but space and time arevery fluid in wakefulnessspace and time are very anchored byphysical events in the world but ourperception of those is dynamicallyregulated by how much dopamine is in oursystem so it&amp;#39;s beginning to sound likedopamine does everything but it&amp;#39;s reallyassociated with motivation craving andtime interval keeping and so i would bewilling to bet that your pulses ofdopamine were very regular just likedropsso interesting so we do a lot of thingswho knows what i was doing at thatperiod if it had to do anything justthat i&amp;#39;m getting older and so it startsto disrupt itself who knows butwhat are some things so one thing i&amp;#39;veheard you talk about which i find reallyinterestingwhen i think about all the things thatwe&amp;#39;re doing that are disrupting thingsall these unintended consequences ofmodern behaviori am truly glad thatcell phones the internet and pornographydid not exist when i was younger becausei don&amp;#39;t know if at 14i could have been disciplined enough ifi had access to that andwhat like when you think about thethings that we&amp;#39;re doing right now thatare sort of the that have maybe the mostgrand unintended consequences where doyou landyeah on the time scale of 24 hours oneof the the huge mistakes that we allmake and i&amp;#39;m i&amp;#39;ve said this many timesso if people have heard me say thisbefore forgive me but it turns out it&amp;#39;sstill trueuhgetting too much bright light exposurefrom the hours of 10 pm until 4 amunless you have to work shift work whichis a unique casethat bright light exposure between 10 pmand 4 am even if youadjust the colors of the lights youstill need to get everything reallyreally dim because it actuallyblocks the release of dopamine through apathway that involves a structure calledthe habenulathe habenula was a kind of crypticstructure in the brain for a long timebut now we know there&amp;#39;s a punishmentsignal in the brain you getneurochemically punishedfor viewing bright light at those hourshow how would that be wired in we&amp;#39;dnever be able to expose ourselves tobright light ah so that&amp;#39;s a greatquestion so firelight won&amp;#39;t do thatmoonlight&amp;#39;s fine candles lights that aredim are now in your environmentso the the pathway to the habenula andthen to these dopamine reducing circuitsare the pain pathway that we&amp;#39;rereferring to earlier it&amp;#39;s a genericpathway through which lots of differenttypes of signals and stimuli and eventscan punish us internally this is so gooddude and so i&amp;#39;m going to call this therich kid effectlike there and you mentioned hard workearlier there is a reason i think thatchildren of wealthy parents end upimploding because there is a anevolutionary the punishment pathwayevolutionary thing that&amp;#39;s going on thatsays you didn&amp;#39;t have to work hard forthe things that you own and because fromuh i need you to go hunt and gather andface a saber-toothed tiger i have toreward you for doing hard things andpunish you for not doing hard thingswell andyou know in the case of the thethe generic model of the of the spoiledrich kid it they actually can&amp;#39;t accessdopamine uh remember that that a moviefrom the 80s it was a uh it was calledlike the toy or something with richard iwas like if this [ __ ] says toyi&amp;#39;m gonna have a seizure yesrichard pryor in that movie and the kidhas everything and he&amp;#39;s the he&amp;#39;s theepitome of the spoiled brat all the toysall the cars all the things now we seethis with people who actually go fromrags to riches and then bathe in alltheir the luxuries they didn&amp;#39;t have as achild these are often the athletes thatdon&amp;#39;t go on to perform well againthese are people that crash because ofother dopamine-seeking behaviors youknow i&amp;#39;m not going to call out names butthere are far too many examples of theseand i don&amp;#39;t call out names mostlybecause we are all capable of this weall would like to think that oh if i hadall that money or if i had all thatsuccess i would really be a good humanbeing and i wouldn&amp;#39;t do those thingsanyone any human being that is immersedin these dopamine circuits too much orwho gets too much pleasure withouthaving to pursue it first and reallywork andactually experience pain pleasureratcheting back and forth along thatclimb because it wasn&amp;#39;t just dopaminelike this for you it&amp;#39;s probably painpleasure pain pleasure painpleasure pain right they&amp;#39;re alwaysproportional to one anotherso anyone that does that it has atremendously hard time accessingpleasurethey can&amp;#39;t do that and and we oftenthink about the extremes of addictionand those are really severe but we alsohave to think about the more subtleforms of something we really love butindulging in it just a little too oftenso that it no longer has that edgeyou know there have been really goodstudies of people who jump out ofairplanes with parachutes you knowi&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s a lot of fun it looks likea thrill but people do over and over andover againoften diedoing other things they often becomedrug addicts because it&amp;#39;s a huge high ohyeah yeah a lot of thatand you know there are a lot of examplesof this i mean you can get addicted toanything the key is to regulate thatbehavior so you asked whatyou know what should people do wellcertainlyi&amp;#39;m trying this now and i have some goodexamples some young people i know andwork with are taking breaks from notjust social media but no cell phonewhatsoever i&amp;#39;m actually trying an oddexperiment which isfor the first hour of every day no phonemostly because part of your 25 no-gosyesright so we have circuitry in the brainrelated to the so-called basal gangliaand we have go sort of activating youknow think gas pedal and then we there&amp;#39;sa lot of no go circuitryandlearning how to keep that no go don&amp;#39;tcircuitry as we could call ituh tuned up is very important and somany times throughout the day but i tryand get 25 a day where i activelyrefrain from doing something that iimpulsively want to do could be lookingat my phone but it could even besomething trivial like i want to walk tothe kitchen and get a glass of water soi&amp;#39;m actively engaging inself-denin denial not cognitive denial probablythat too but how would i know um but inaction-based denial so restricting mybehavior in some way as a way of keepingthese dopamine circuits tuned up alsonot looking at my phone first thing inthe morning for an hour becauseknowing what we now know about thesecond phase of sleep and rem sleepbeing more predominant the second waveof sleep and the fact that you&amp;#39;reworking through a lot of emotional andlogistical contingencies you&amp;#39;rereshaping your brain in sleep that&amp;#39;swhen neuroplasticity occurs during sleepit&amp;#39;s triggered in wakefulness but itactually takes place in sleep especiallythat second half of sleepwhen you wake up in the morning you arein a perfect position to what i callreceive the download of all the workthat your neural circuitry has beendoing the night before but if youimmediately go to a sensory experienceespecially a rich sensory experience ofstuff scrolling by you&amp;#39;re actuallymissing the information that youprocessed at night and even moreimportantly that second half of thenight during rem sleep is when theemotional weight of things start becomeslet&amp;#39;s sayyou put it on the shelf properly thingsthat are important to emotionalemotionally registered get put in oneshelf things that were like the commentyou got on twitter that was triggeringdoesn&amp;#39;t seem like such a big deal aftera good night&amp;#39;s sleep and that&amp;#39;s becausethat second half of sleep is actuallywhen you re-experience these things butyour body can&amp;#39;t secrete adrenaline it&amp;#39;skind of an internal form of therapy oreven trauma therapy and that&amp;#39;s whypeople who don&amp;#39;t get that sleep are veryyou know they&amp;#39;re easily agitated theyfeel like the world is crushing down onthem so when i wake up in the morning iwant to receive ideas that i want tolearn from my learning and if you takein new information you are not in aposition to do that and 60 minutes is atough one so i give myself two no-gosfor the 60-minute block if i can do itand i&amp;#39;ll tell you a lot of mornings ifail tom i don&amp;#39;t do it interesting ijust i found that shocking but i heardyou say that in another interview and iwas like well i mean i&amp;#39;m human you knowthere are mornings whereum i get enticed or worseworse i find myself reflexively pickingup without having made the consciousdecision and that&amp;#39;s wheni realized thatyou know we are alldeep in this process and i thinkuh we have to regulate it the theexperiment i&amp;#39;d like to do maybe you&amp;#39;lldo this with me as a challenge becausethe challenge is always good is in thenew year i actually want to take everyodd waking hour of the day off the phoneso even hours of the dayas long as it&amp;#39;s waking i&amp;#39;m willing tohave it on and work with it but oddhours just turn it off no matter whati don&amp;#39;t know if this will destroy mostof the relationshipsbut just to see can i do it on a rigidlyexternally imposed schedule because ifyou think about most of the growth inlife comes from these rigidly externallyimposed schedules and we hate thembut they are where we learn restraintdude this is so important i don&amp;#39;t knowif i hate them anymore so people willoften ask like how i do this that or theother whatever it is like tom how do youumso i work 93 hours a week that&amp;#39;s like myaverage that&amp;#39;s your average sotom why do you work 93 hours every weekand the answer is because 93 are joyfuland 94 wouldn&amp;#39;tandwhen i start working more than that itusually means that i&amp;#39;m juggling so manythings that my brain seems to be usingsleep as a way to track some of them orsomething yeah so i find myself wakingup a lot no i have a trick that allowsme to fall back asleep very fast butit&amp;#39;s still not as restful as justsleeping through the night what&amp;#39;s thetrick if you don&amp;#39;t mind me entering idon&amp;#39;t at all so i have two pairs ofairpod headphonesand i put them inand i put them on a uhfiction book and i turn the volume downsuch that if i don&amp;#39;t put a little bit ofpressure on my ear i can&amp;#39;t make out whatthey&amp;#39;re saying so as soon as i drift offthe pressure releases and i can stillhear that noise is being made but ican&amp;#39;t track it and so i&amp;#39;m usually outprobably in about three minutes wow thatthat changed my life in terms of when iget stressed i can still fall backasleep such a great skill and justreflecting on what you usethat murmur in the background and thiskind of low level i can&amp;#39;t quite detectit is actually the way that your braindetects things as you&amp;#39;re falling asleepso i wonder if you&amp;#39;ve triggered yourcircuit to run in reverse where youactually can send yourself back underwhat what it makes me think is that ican&amp;#39;tprocess the problemsand listen to a story at the same timeand so my brain clicks over into storymode and it&amp;#39;s like oh we&amp;#39;re digestingthis story i i&amp;#39;m getting input sobecause i&amp;#39;m getting input because it&amp;#39;sstory my brain lets go of i have tosolve problems and then that allows meto fall right back asleep that&amp;#39;s greatsuch a great skill and waking up in themiddle of the night from time to time touse the bathroom is actually quitenormaland some people are really obsessed bythe fact oh no i woke up and then theyget triggered but i learned this lastyear umthat thepeak in our alertness is actually about90 minutes before our natural bedtimeand a lot of people they you know theyreach the point in the evening wherethey&amp;#39;reready to go to sleep and then they feelall this you know excitement and surgeof energy and they think oh no i&amp;#39;m notgoing to be able to fall asleep butthat&amp;#39;s actually a natural surge that&amp;#39;sfollowed by a dip a lot of people alsohave the trouble of waking up in themiddle of the night and wondering whythey can&amp;#39;t fall back asleep this isdreadfully hard for a lot of people istruggled that for years yeah and one ofthe solutions is to go to bed earlierbecause it means that your melatonin isstarting to get released early in theevening and so we all have the naturalability to push to stay late stay uplater if we really need to this hasobvious adaptive utility but some peopleby who should go to bed quote unquoteshould go to bed at 9 or 10 p.m they&amp;#39;repushing to 11 or 12 and then theirmelatonin signal is starting to drop offnow they can&amp;#39;t fall asleepor they&amp;#39;re waking up at two or three inthe morning and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re introuble but it sounds like you&amp;#39;ve hitthe right schedule 93 hours is animpressive outputthat&amp;#39;s a lot of years of making anobscene amount of mistakes and to closethe loop on so people how do youaccomplish xyz and the answer is partlyrulesso you have to be obsessed with yourgoal right so for me that&amp;#39;s allobsessions start with a goal what do youwant is that thing exciting andhonorable assuming it&amp;#39;s exciting andhonorable there&amp;#39;s ways to like createfeedback loops which is largely whatwe&amp;#39;ve been talking about today aboutattaching the dopaminergic responsespecifically to the pursuit of thatthing rather than having itandbyto because i&amp;#39;m so excited and because iso believe in the reality of my goalsthat i actually could have them and thathaving them would be awesomei can create rules in my life and then ireally stick to those rules so once i&amp;#39;mvery careful about what rules i put inplace because i have to believe thatthey will actually lead me to this goalthat&amp;#39;s really exciting for me but if ibelieve it then i can put them in andthen also part of my identity is thati&amp;#39;m the type of person that when i set arule i follow it so i can create thisloop of like feeling good about myselfand the thing that i&amp;#39;m pursuing but itreally works and i&amp;#39;m shocked how fewpeople have the kind of rule that you&amp;#39;retalking about in the new year to say heyi&amp;#39;m only going to do odd hours there&amp;#39;sno phone yeah well and like i said i&amp;#39;mnot perfect i&amp;#39;m not as disciplined asyou are about my no goes i try iactually find that tabulating is is kindof funum it&amp;#39;s also fun to get reallytriggering commentsand and to not close the dopamine loopfor them i think if people understood umthe dopamine reward prediction errorthat we could end all the umamplifying comment battles onlinebecause what happens is if someone takesa a jab at you of any kind there&amp;#39;sactually an open dopamine loop waitingfor you to respond and any responseactually gives them that that dopamineresponse of success it&amp;#39;s a little bit ofa it&amp;#39;s like scoring a three-pointer andthe no response actually drops theirdopamine below baseline and that&amp;#39;s itsown form of retaliation and i have to becareful because i don&amp;#39;t want toencourage people to retaliate but anyanything that short-circuits the kind ofmadness of getting pulled intosome online battle that&amp;#39;s totallymeaningless it&amp;#39;s taking people away fromother powerful good things that theycould do in the worldyou know we&amp;#39;ve been talking mainly aboutdopamine and its scheduling and aboutthe fact that it can be attached toanything i thinkmany people find it hard to subjectivelyattach dopamine to something they don&amp;#39;twant to do this is something that uh ifwe&amp;#39;d spoken a year ago i would&amp;#39;ve i myanswer would have been a little bitdifferent to the question of how do youget motivated well one way to do that isif you are good at subjectivelyattachingdopamine to the pursuit just knowingokay i really am hungry for this i&amp;#39;mjust i&amp;#39;m going to tell myself that youknow making you know making it onepercent of the wayis a success and i&amp;#39;m going to keep goingand i&amp;#39;m going to keep ratcheting on andthat&amp;#39;s great if you can do that but forpeople that can&amp;#39;t do that understandingthis relationship with a pleasure painbalance can be more powerful justunderstanding the more friction and painthat you experience the greater thedopamine reward you will get later andthat serves as its own amplifier of thewhole process of pursuing more dopamineand then the other aspect of itis that any time that we&amp;#39;re leaning intoactionyou know it has thepossibility of being an amplifyingprocess or a depleting processand the key to that is making sure thatyou&amp;#39;re balancing the dopamine andepinephrine systems you know epinephrinebeing this molecule of universalcurrency of energy output it could beout of hate or it could be out of loveepinephrine doesn&amp;#39;t care and actuallydopamine doesn&amp;#39;t care none of thesesystems care about us they justwork underneath our underneath ourconscious control but when you start tounderstand thathitting the gas pedal is great buthitting the gas pedal and then comingoff the gas pedal a little bityou can kind of sit in a more relaxedrpm actually allows you to go muchfurther i think that peopleleaning into action is terrific i alwayssay you can either be back on your heelsflat footed or forward center of massthe best situation is actually to beright upright but just know that you canbe forward center of mass at any pointand you know that to take it back to sexand reproduction because it&amp;#39;s a salientexample the arc of of sex is veryinteresting because when you think aboutautonomic arousal it turns out that thethe arousal stage of sex actuallyinvolves release of dopaminebut is what we call parasympatheticdominant it&amp;#39;s actually has to be relaxedenoughin order to occur okay everyone can readbetween the lines on thisorgasm is actuallyai want to say full blown it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s ait is a sympatheticnervous system driven response it&amp;#39;sidentical to the stress system it&amp;#39;sdriven by the same neural circuits asstressand then what comes afterwardthe parasympathetic system goes back upagain it&amp;#39;s that deep relaxation so whydo i say this not to talk about sex tobeyou know to to serve as a highlighterbut rather our species arrived herebecause of this dance between arousaland relaxation arousal and relaxationand one thing we can say for sure aboutevery human being that&amp;#39;s alive now isthat their parents at least oncemastered this dance of relaxed but notand excited but not too excited thenreally excited and then relaxed thatdance was mastered by all of our parentsand that&amp;#39;s what delivered us here tosome extent and so iwhat this means is that all the neuralcircuits from the ones that led to ourconception to the ones that lead to uspursuing goals have thisbalance that&amp;#39;s almost like a like aseesaw right there&amp;#39;s activation and calmactivation and calm and it&amp;#39;s thatdynamic process that&amp;#39;s important tomaster in every endeavor so we use sexas an example but in pursuit of goalsyou have to learn how to pursueshort-term goalsand like the goals within the day make acup of coffee and goal and long-termgoals and when i said dopamine is what&amp;#39;ssetting theyour time perception it&amp;#39;s an intervaltimerwhat you&amp;#39;re saying is it&amp;#39;s like the twomarshmallow experiment done at stanforddef defer the dopamineand actually if you can turn the waitinginto the dopamine and thenyou can extend out the reward for youknow waiting for the second marshmallow15 minutes later et cetera et cetera andthere are many many examples of this inthe psychology and neuroscienceliterature and i would say finally in2020 we finally as a field got a clearidea of how dopamine is really workingbecause before it was all aboutwork dopamine hit rightsex gives you a doubling hit theinternet gives you a dopamine what wedidn&amp;#39;t realize is that repeatedengagement with these things leads todopamine depletionand that the pain and pleasure balanceis always at workdude that&amp;#39;s so brilliant dudeone the huberman lab is amazing onyoutube people need to check that [ __ ]out and your instagram page is alsoamazingwhere do you want people to follow youat yeah so well thanks um for those kindwords um yes i mean them so aggressivelyi&amp;#39;ll bite through the camera to letpeople know how seriously i mean thatthank you yeah so i i have an instagrampage it&amp;#39;s huberman lab and there i teachneuroscience in anywhere from one minuteto you know five minute tidbits and alot of actionable tools that relate toall sorts of things sleep and motivationetc and then the huberman lab podcast isapple spotify and we have a youtubechannel for people want to watch andlisten to it and they&amp;#39;reit&amp;#39;s a little bit different than mostpodcasts because i will do four episodesall on one general theme like food andthe brainand these are longhour to two hour long lectures where ijust kind of blab on and on myself butthey&amp;#39;re all time stamps so people canget information there and it&amp;#39;s tools andscience and then we have great guests onwho are expert in their fields peoplelike anna lemke um luminaries and theyou know matt walker folks of that sortof robertwho i&amp;#39;ve been stockingthere&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a
