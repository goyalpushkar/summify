what is the difference between\\\\n[00:00:08] a facial oil and a serum i know a lot\\\\n[00:00:10] of you get confused and think they're the\\\\n[00:00:12] same thing or don't really know when to\\\\n[00:00:13] use what so i'm going to break it down\\\\n[00:00:15] for you guys today so let's go ahead and\\\\n[00:00:16] dive right in so first let's talk about\\\\n[00:00:18] facial oils what are they well facial\\\\n[00:00:20] oils are usually single ingredient or\\\\n[00:00:22] can be a blend of different oils that\\\\n[00:00:25] have one main purpose and that is to\\\\n[00:00:27] moisturize and nourish the skin they help\\\\n[00:00:30] hydrate the skin by creating a protective\\\\n[00:00:32] barrier that traps moisture in\\\\n[00:00:34] preventing water loss and keeping the\\\\n[00:00:36] skin soft and supple\\\\n[00:00:38] facial oils are typically rich in\\\\n[00:00:40] essential fatty acids antioxidants and\\\\n[00:00:43] vitamins which can provide additional\\\\n[00:00:45] benefits such as reducing inflammation\\\\n[00:00:48] improving skin tone and protecting\\\\n[00:00:50] against environmental damage if you have\\\\n[00:00:52] extremely dry skin a facial oil is going\\\\n[00:00:54] to be your best friend because it's going\\\\n[00:00:56] to provide intense hydration but also\\\\n[00:00:58] really help to seal in all of that\\\\n[00:01:00] moisture so you don't lose it throughout\\\\n[00:01:01] the day\\\\n[00:01:02] now let's talk about serums what are they\\\\n[00:01:04] well serums are lightweight skincare\\\\n[00:01:06] products that are formulated with a high\\\\n[00:01:08] concentration of active ingredients that\\\\n[00:01:11] are designed to target specific skin\\\\n[00:01:13] concerns\\\\n[00:01:14] serums are typically water-based or\\\\n[00:01:16] oil-based and have a thin consistency\\\\n[00:01:19] which allows them to penetrate deeply into\\\\n[00:01:21] the skin they're formulated to address a\\\\n[00:01:23] wide range of skin concerns such as\\\\n[00:01:26] fine lines wrinkles hyperpigmentation\\\\n[00:01:29] acne and dullness some common active\\\\n[00:01:32] ingredients found in serums include\\\\n[00:01:34] vitamin c hyaluronic acid retinol and\\\\n[00:01:37] peptides\\\\n[00:01:39] so now that we've covered what facial\\\\n[00:01:40] oils and serums are let's talk about the\\\\n[00:01:42] key differences between the two the\\\\n[00:01:44] first main difference is going to be the\\\\n[00:01:46] texture facial oils have a thicker\\\\n[00:01:48] richer consistency compared to serums\\\\n[00:01:51] serums tend to be more lightweight and\\\\n[00:01:53] absorb more quickly into the skin\\\\n[00:01:55] another main difference is going to be the\\\\n[00:01:56] purpose of the product facial oils are\\\\n[00:01:59] primarily used for moisturizing and\\\\n[00:02:00] nourishing the skin while serums are\\\\n[00:02:03] designed to target specific skin concerns\\\\n[00:02:05] with a concentrated dose of active\\\\n[00:02:07] ingredients when incorporating a facial\\\\n[00:02:09] oil and a serum into your skincare routine\\\\n[00:02:11] it's important to layer them in the\\\\n[00:02:13] correct order generally you should apply\\\\n[00:02:15] your serum first after cleansing and\\\\n[00:02:17] toning allowing it to fully absorb into\\\\n[00:02:19] the skin\\\\n[00:02:20] then you would follow with your facial oil\\\\n[00:02:22] to seal in the serum and provide an\\\\n[00:02:24] additional layer of hydration your facial\\\\n[00:02:26] oil is going to be the last step in your\\\\n[00:02:27] skincare routine so that it can seal in\\\\n[00:02:30] all of the products you've put on before\\\\n[00:02:31] it\\\\n[00:02:32] if you apply your facial oil before your\\\\n[00:02:34] serum the serum won't be able to properly\\\\n[00:02:36] absorb into the skin because the oil will\\\\n[00:02:38] create a barrier\\\\n[00:02:40] so to wrap things up facial oils are\\\\n[00:02:42] mainly used to moisturize and nourish the\\\\n[00:02:44] skin while serums are formulated
