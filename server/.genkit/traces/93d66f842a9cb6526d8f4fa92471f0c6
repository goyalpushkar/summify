This was the first order at this new Samsung chip factory.[16]\\n\\nOn February 19, 2024, Groq soft launched a developer platform, GroqCloud, to attract developers into using the Groq API and rent access to their chips.[17][1] On March 1, 2024 Groq acquired Definitive Intelligence, a startup known for offering a range of business-oriented AI solutions, to help with its cloud platform.[18]\\n\\nGroq raised $640 million in a series D round led by BlackRock Private Equity Partners in August 2024, valuing the company at $2.8 billion.[1][19]\\n\\nA recent update by Groq on its website is that they have secured 1.5 Billion in funding from the KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) to expand its infrastructure. [20]\\n\\nGroq's initial name for their ASIC was the Tensor Streaming Processor (TSP), but later rebranded the TSP as the Language Processing Unit (LPU).[2][21][22]\\n\\nThe LPU features a functionally sliced microarchitecture, where memory units are interleaved with vector and matrix computation units.[23][24] This design facilitates the exploitation of dataflow locality in AI compute graphs, improving execution performance and efficiency. The LPU was designed off of two key observations:\\n\\nIn addition to its functionally sliced microarchitecture, the LPU can also be characterized by its single core, deterministic architecture.[23][25] The LPU is able to achieve deterministic execution by avoiding the use of traditional reactive hardware components (branch predictors, arbiters, reordering buffers, caches)[23] and by having all execution explicitly controlled by the compiler thereby guaranteeing determinism in execution of an LPU program.[24]\\n\\nThe first generation of the LPU (LPU v1) yields a computational density of more than 1TeraOp/s per square mm of silicon for its 25×29 mm 14nm chip operating at a nominal clock frequency of 900 MHz.[23] The second generation of the LPU (LPU v2) will be manufactured on Samsung's 4nm process node.[16]\\n\\nGroq emerged as the first API provider to break the 100 tokens per second generation rate while running Meta’s Llama2-70B parameter model.[26]\\n\\nGroq currently hosts a variety of open-source large language models running on its LPUs for public access.[27] Access to these demos are available through Groq's website. The LPU's performance while running these open source LLMs has been independently benchmarked by ArtificialAnalysis.ai, in comparison with other LLM providers.[28] The LPU's measured performance is shown in the table below:\\n\"}","genkit:state":"success"},"displayName":"getWebCations","links":[],"instrumentationLibrary":{"name":"genkit-tracer","version":"v1"},"spanKind":"INTERNAL","sameProcessAsParentSpan":{"value":true},"status":{"code":0},"timeEvents":{"timeEvent":[]}}}}
