Today's video is about Jira automation. Automation in Jira allows you to set up rules that will automatically perform actions when certain events occur in Jira. This can save you a lot of time and effort by automating repetitive tasks and streamlining your workflows. Automation can be used for a variety of purposes, such as automatically assigning issues to the correct person, automatically closing issues when they are resolved, or automatically sending notifications when an issue is created or updated. To access the automation features in Jira, you'll need to have admin permissions for your project or instance. Once you have the necessary permissions, you can access the automation features by going to project settings and selecting automation, or by going to the admin settings and selecting automation. In this video, I'm going to walk you through the basics of Jira automation and show you how to set up some simple rules. To start, let's create a new rule that will automatically assign issues to the correct person based on the issue type. To do this, we'll go to the project settings, select automation, and then click the create rule button. This will bring up a screen where you can choose a trigger for your rule. A trigger is an event that will cause the rule to run. In this case, we want the rule to run when an issue is created. So we'll select the issue created trigger. Next, we need to specify the conditions for the rule. Conditions are criteria that must be met for the rule to run. In this case, we want the rule to only run for issues of a certain type. So we'll add a condition that checks the issue type. We'll select the issue fields condition, and then we'll choose issue type from the field drop down. Then we'll set the condition to be equal to bug. This means that the rule will only run for issues that are of type bug. Finally, we need to specify the actions that the rule will perform. Actions are the things that the rule will do when it runs. In this case, we want the rule to assign the issue to a specific person. So we'll add an action that assigns the issue. We'll select the assign issue action, and then we'll choose the person to assign the issue to. Once we've configured the trigger, conditions, and actions for our rule, we can click the publish button to activate the rule. Now, whenever a new issue of type bug is created, the rule will automatically assign it to the person that we specified. That's just a simple example of what you can do with Jira automation. You can use automation to automate a wide variety of tasks and streamline your workflows. I encourage you to explore the automation features in Jira and see how they can help you save time and effort.
